<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
ADVENTURE I
<br><br>
GRANDMA BAKES A CAKE
</h3>

<p>
"Come, children, it is time to go to
school!"
</p>

<p>
Grandma Harden waddled out on the
front porch of the Happy Home where
Nat and Weezie were playing with
Rodney and Addie, the boy and girl from
next door.  Nat, whose real name was
Nathaniel, and Weezie, whose real name
was Louisa, called their house "Happy
Home," because they had so much fun
and so many jolly adventures in it.
</p>

<p>
Thump, who was Rodney's dog, was
sitting on the bottom step of the porch,
waiting for some one to throw a stone, so
that he might run after it to bring it
back.
</p>

<p>
But Rodney and Nat were too busy,
talking about going fishing, to think of
throwing stones for Thump.  And Weezie
and Addie were trying a new dress on
Addie's doll, so, of course, they couldn't
play with a dog.
</p>

<p>
Thump wagged his tail and whined
softly.  That was his way of saying:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please, somebody, throw a stone!
Let me show you how fast I can run after
it!"
</p>

<p>
But Grandma waddled farther out on
the porch&mdash;she just had to waddle like a
duck because she was so jolly and fat&mdash;and
Grandma said again:
</p>

<p>
"Come, my dears, it's time to go to
school!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wish there wasn't any school!"
exclaimed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"So do I!" echoed his chum.  "Then
we could go fishing now, instead of
waiting until after school!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll have a lot more fun fishing, if
you go to school first," said Grandma.
"Then you won't be worrying over the
lessons you missed."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't worry over any lessons!"
boasted Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Nor I," said Nat.  "School's no fun!
But I guess we'll have to go."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," sighed his chum, and slowly
they got to their feet.  Thump took this
as a sign they were going to throw stones
for him, or, at least, play in some way, so
he leaped joyfully about and barked.
</p>

<p>
But a moment later Thump's happy
bark stopped, his wagging tail drooped
between his legs and he looked sad as
Rodney cried:
</p>

<p>
"Go home, Thump!  Go back home!"
</p>

<p>
"Poor dog!" murmured Grandma
Harden.  Thump looked up on hearing a
friendly voice, and wagged his tail again.
"He would so love to come with you!"
said the dear, old lady.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to have him," admitted Rodney,
"but if I let Mm come part way it's
harder to make him go home."
</p>

<p>
"The other day he walked right into
school after us!" said Addie with a laugh.
"And the teacher made Rod come out
with Thump."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, say!" eagerly exclaimed Nat,
"let's take him along now, and if he comes
in school I'll ask teacher if I can't help
you lead him out, and we could be a long
while at it and not go back, maybe until
school was almost out!  Hey!  How about
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing at all about that!" laughed
Grandma, until her body was shaking like
a big bowl of jelly&mdash;Oh, Grandma Harden
was very fat&mdash;there was no getting away
from that!  "Don't try any such tricks!"
she went on, playfully shaking her fingers
at the boys.  "It wouldn't be right to use
a dog like that!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I guess it wouldn't," agreed
Rodney.  "Go on home, Thump," he said,
more softly.  "We'll play with you this
afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"We'll take you fishing with us," added
Nat.  "We'll have to do all our fishing
pretty soon, now," he added as he and his
chum walked toward the front gate, while
Thump, still sadly drooping his tail, slunk
off through the grass to his kennel next
door.
</p>

<p>
"Why shall we have to do all our fishing
soon?" asked Rod.
</p>

<p>
"Because it will soon be winter,"
explained Nat.  "The water with the fish in
will freeze."
</p>

<p>
"It's nice and warm to-day," said Weezie,
who walked on ahead, with her playmate,
Addie.  The girls were rather more
afraid, than were the boys, of being late
for school.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's warm to-day," admitted Nat,
"but there was a frost last night, I heard
Daddy say, and to-night may be colder
and freeze water."
</p>

<p>
"Then it will soon be Christmas!"
exclaimed Weezie joyfully.
</p>

<p>
"Ho!  We haven't even had Thanksgiving
yet!" objected her brother.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Thanksgiving is this month and
Christmas is next month," said Weezie,
"so there!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I guess we'll soon have winter,
anyhow," admitted Rod.  "Well, anyhow,
we'll go fishing this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"And take Thump" went on Nat.  He
liked the dog almost as much as did his
chum who owned the animal.
</p>

<p>
Fat Grandma on the porch waved her
hand to the children as they looked back
before turning the corner of the street.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have a surprise for you when you
come home from school," she said.
</p>

<p>
"A surprise?" questioned Weezie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, something you like!"
</p>

<p>
"I wish my Grandma would make a
surprise," sighed Addie.
</p>

<p>
The fat, jolly old lady on the porch
heard this and said:
</p>

<p>
"You may have some of this surprise,
Addie&mdash;you and Rodney.  Come over with
Nat and Weezie after school!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we will!  Thank you!" exclaimed Weezie.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that wonderful!" murmured
Addie, clasping Weezie's arm.  "What
do you suppose the surprise will be?"
</p>

<p>
"It will be a cake!" stated Weezie, calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you <i>know</i>, then it isn't a
<i>surprise</i>," said Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we know it will be a cake, for
Grandma always bakes a cake on Monday
when Lizzie has to do the washing,"
explained Weezie.  "So that's why we know
it's going to be a cake."
</p>

<p>
"But we don't know what kind,"
added Nat, "and that's where the
surprise comes in.  We never know whether
it will be a chocolate cake, or a cocoanut
cake or an orange short-cake or what kind
of a cake it will be."
</p>

<p>
"Any kind of a cake is good," declared
Rodney, "but I like chocolate best."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," agreed Nat.  "Anyhow,
when we come home from school we'll
know what kind it is."
</p>

<p>
"I'll save my piece to take with us
when we go fishing," said Rodney.
"We'll play we're explorers in the woods,
Nat, and that all we have to eat is cake!"
</p>

<p>
"That'll be fun!" agreed his chum.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe Grandma will give you boys
two pieces of cake," suggested Weezie,
as the children hurried on along the street,
for they could hear the ringing of the
school bell.  "You could eat one piece
right away and save the other to take
fishing with you."
</p>

<p>
"That would be the best ever!" cried
Rodney.
</p>

<p>
Having seen the children start for
school, Grandma Harden waddled back
into the house.
</p>

<p>
"Helen," she called to the mother of
Nat and Weezie, "I'm going into the
kitchen and bake a cake, as long as Lizzie
is down in the laundry."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Mother!" answered Mrs. Marden.
She called the jolly, fat old lady
"Mother," though, really, she was only
a mother-in-law.  However, that made no
difference.  "But don't tire yourself out,
Mother," she warned.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take Racky into the kitchen with
me," said old Mrs. Marden.  "I'll sit on
that, and mend some stockings while I'm
waiting for the cake to bake.  I like to
watch my cakes so they won't burn."
</p>

<p>
Now, lest you wonder who Racky was,
that fat, Grandma Marden was going to
sit on in the kitchen, while she made a
cake, I shall tell you.  It was an old
rocking chair!  And it was a very strange,
peculiar old rocking chair, as you shall, very
soon, find out for yourself.
</p>

<p>
Humming a little tune, Grandma Marden
carried her favorite, old rocking chair
to the kitchen.  She had owned this chair
for many years, since the time she kept
house for herself, before she went to live
with her son and his family.
</p>

<p>
The chair was painted brown, and it
had a deep, thick, soft cushion on the seat
and another cushion on the back.  Some
buttons on the back cushion made it look
like a face.
</p>

<p>
"Now I'll just mix up&mdash;let me see&mdash;I
guess I'll make a chocolate cake this
time," murmured the old lady, "I'll just
mix it up and pop it into the oven.  Then,
while it's baking, I'll sit and rock and
mend stockings."
</p>

<p>
She set the chair in a corner, near the
door leading down the cellar steps into the
laundry, where Lizzie, the maid, was
splashing about in the water with the
Monday batch of clothes.
</p>

<p>
Into a brown bowl Grandma Marden
put sugar, flour, milk, baking powder
and whatever else goes into a cake.  She
stirred the batter up until it was frothy
and foamy, and then she poured it into
shallow tins which she set into the oven
of the new gas stove.
</p>

<p>
"Now I'll get the basket of stockings
and rock while the cake is baking," said
the fat old lady.  "I'm not going to have
my cake burned on the edges.  If there's
one thing worse than another, it's a
burned cake, I think!"
</p>

<p>
The old brown rocker, which Grandma
had named "Racky," creaked and
groaned as the fat lady sat down in it
with her basket of mending.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!" murmured Mrs. Harden
with a sighing sort of laugh, "you are
getting old like myself, Racky!  You won't
last much longer!"
</p>

<p>
"I won't if you sit down on me as hard
as that every time!" said Racky.
</p>

<p>
Now don't be surprised.  The rocking
chair did not speak out loud, though, when
it was needful, it could talk.  But this
time the chair was speaking to itself.
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, I won't last much longer
if you drop into me that way!" whispered
the chair.  "You're getting fatter than
ever, old lady!"
</p>

<p>
This was true enough, but Grandma
Marden didn't mind that.  She would
have been surprised, though, to hear the
chair speak, for she did not know her old
rocker had anything wonderful, or magical,
about it, as, indeed, it had.
</p>

<p>
To and fro rocked Grandma, humming
a little song to herself as she plied her
needle in and out, mending holes that Nat
and Weezie had worn in their stockings.
Many holes there were, for the children
ran about like little wild Indians as soon
as they came from school.
</p>

<p>
Every now and then Grandma would
get up out of the rocker and look in the
oven of the gas stove, to make sure the
cake was not burning.  And each time she
sat down again, the chair creaked and
groaned and squeaked, and seemed to
shake as if it would fall apart.
</p>

<p>
"I say there!  Easy, Grandma!"
exclaimed the chair as the fat old lady sat
down particularly hard after about her
third look in the oven.  "Be a bit careful,
if you please!  You'll break one of
my legs, or a rocker, if you sit down so
heavily!  Then I'll be put away up in
the attic with the other old furniture, and
that will be the end of me!  Don't sit on
me so hard!"
</p>

<p>
But Grandma only laughed as she heard
the chair creaking and groaning in its
joints, and she said, again:
</p>

<p>
"You're getting old like myself, Racky!"
</p>

<p>
Back and forth she rocked, and then she
laughed and exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Well, I declare!  You're a regular
traveler, Racky!  Here you are away over
by the sink, though when I first sat in you
it was near the cellar door.  You're a
regular traveler!"
</p>

<p>
And so the rocking chair was.  I dare
say you have heard of traveling rockers.
If you sit in them on one side of the
room, and sway to and fro, in a little while
you will find yourself on the other side of
the room.
</p>

<p>
Racky, the rocker, was this kind of a
chair, though he had never given it much
thought.  But now, all of a sudden, a
daring plan came into his mind.  For, in a
way, Racky could think, and act and talk.
</p>

<p>
Grandma picked up the traveling
rocker and set it down again near the
cellar door.  She swung herself backward
and forward, finishing the song she was
humming, and also mending the last
stocking.
</p>

<p>
Then she wanted to get up, but she had
leaned so far back in the chair that she
had to try twice before she could rise.
And, after the first falling back, the
rocker creaked and strained so under her
weight that the old lady exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, are you going to break a leg?"
</p>

<p>
"I certainly hope not!" thought Racky,
though, for a moment, he feared something
like this had happened.  But it was
only his old joints creaking.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you seem to be all right," went
on Grandma as, finally, sue managed to
get up.  "We are growing old together,
Racky&mdash;you and I&mdash;growing old together!
But you may last a few more years."
</p>

<p>
"I won't if you keep on sitting down
on me as hard as you did just then!" said
the chair to himself.  "You have no idea
how you hurt me!  One leg is splintered,
I'm sure!"
</p>

<p>
Grandma Harden took off her glasses
and tucked them down in a snug place
between the seat and back cushions of the
chair.  She did not have to wear her
spectacles to see to take the layers of cake
from the oven, for they were now baked.
Only when she sewed, mended or read
stories to the children did Grandma need
her glasses.  So now she left them in the
old, traveling rocking chair.
</p>

<p>
Setting the hot cakes on the table, the
old lady went to the front hall to ask her
daughter-in-law where the chocolate was
kept.
</p>

<p>
And while Grandma was out of the
kitchen, Racky decided on something very
bold and strange.
</p>

<p>
The door leading down into the
laundry was open.  Out of the kitchen
window Racky could look and see Lizzie in
the yard hanging out the clothes.  And
there was no sign of a blackbird coming
along to nip at her nose.
</p>

<p>
So it happened that Racky was alone
in the kitchen, and Gassy, the stove, was
alone down in the laundry.
</p>

<p>
As I have told you, in another of these
"Happy Home" books, entitled "The
Adventures of the Galloping Gas Stove,"
Gassy had gone through some wonderful
experiences.  Having heard, somehow,
that a new stove was to be put into the
kitchen, in his place, Gassy decided to run
away!  And, what is more, he did, and
with him ran Thump, the dog, who had
been scolded because he came into the
kitchen with muddy paws!  As if that
mattered!
</p>

<p>
Gassy and Thump had many strange
adventures together before they came
home with Rodney, Addie, Nat and Weezie,
who had gone to search for the runaways.
They all came home on the back
of an elephant, as you may read in the
book about Gassy's adventures.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Zink, the plumber, brought a new
stove for the Harden kitchen, but as
Gassy still was useful, he was put down
in the laundry, where he made the best of
it with the wringer and the tubs for company.
</p>

<p>
And now something else was going to
happen.  Racky, who was still creaking
from Grandma's weight, softly called
down the cellar stairs:
</p>

<p>
"Gassy, are you there?  Hello, Gassy!"
</p>

<p>
"Where else would I be?" asked the
stove.  "I can't get away since the gas
pipes hold me fast.  What did you want,
Racky?"
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to ask how you ran away that
time," went on Racky.
</p>

<p>
The rocking chair could still see
Lizzie out in the garden hanging up the
clothes, and Grandma was still talking to
Mrs. Marden about the chocolate, which
seemed to have been mislaid.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you want to know how I ran away;
is that it?" asked the stove in the laundry.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  How did you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, having four legs, I just
galloped away like a horse," was the
answer.  "That's all there was to it.  I
galloped away.  But why do you ask,
Racky?"
</p>

<p>
"Because," replied the chair in a
hoarse and creaking whisper, "because
that's what I'm going to do!"
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried Gassy.  "You are going
to run away?"
</p>

<p>
"I have fully made up my mind to run
away!" declared the rocker.
</p>

<p>
"What for?" asked the stove.  "What
in the world for?  Don't you like it in this
jolly house?"
</p>

<p>
"I like it well enough," went on the
chair, "but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And just then there was a sound in the
hall as if Grandma was coming back to
mix the chocolate to put on the cake.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute&mdash;I'll tell you later!"
whispered Racky.
</p>

<h3>
ADVENTURE II
<br><br>
RACKY RUNS AWAY
</h3>

<p>
While Gassy, the old stove down in the
laundry, was waiting for Racky to give
his reasons for wanting to run away, the
rocker was listening up in the kitchen.
The noise he had heard when he was in the
middle of his story, he thought was made
by Grandma coming back.
</p>

<p>
But it must have been a false alarm, for
the old lady was still out in the hall,
talking to the mother of Nat and Weezie.
She had found out that the chocolate was
on a shelf in the pantry, instead of being
in the white, kitchen cabinet, where it was
usually kept.  But now Grandma was
talking to Mrs. Trent, the mother of
Rodney and Addie.  Mrs. Trent had run over
to bring a letter which the postman, by
mistake, had left at her house instead of at
the Harden home.  And, so, knowing that
Grandma would not come back to the
kitchen for a few moments yet, Racky
went on:
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to run away, Gassy, so I
won't be broken to pieces!"
</p>

<p>
"Broken to pieces!  What do you
mean?" asked the gas stove.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's like this," explained Backy
as he rocked to and fro on the kitchen
linoleum.  "Old Grandma is getting
fatter and heavier day by day.  Every
time she sits down in me I'm afraid she'll
go through the seat, or at least crack one
of my legs."
</p>

<p>
"That's a terrible thing to have happen!"
spoke Gassy.  "That's one reason
why they got a new stove in my place and
put me down in the laundry&mdash;because I
had a broken leg."
</p>

<p>
"I can't stand it to think of such a
thing!" cried Backy.  "So before the old
lady gets any heavier, I've decided to do
just what you did&mdash;run away.  But I
don't know anything about how it is done.
Please tell me!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, you just watch your chance, as
I did, and, when no one is around to stop
you, trot off," advised the gas stove.
"You aren't like I was&mdash;fastened to the
wall by gas pipes.  It ought to be easy
for you to run away.  You can move
about; can't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," answered the rocker.  "Only
a little while ago I moved half way across
the kitchen.  Grandma said I was quite a
traveler!"
</p>

<p>
"Then what more do you want?" asked
the stove.  "Watch your chance and start
out.  I wish you joy and luck!  You'll
have many adventures!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?" asked the chair
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of it," replied the laundry
stove.  "And when you come back, tell
me all about what happened."
</p>

<p>
"I am not coming back!" declared the
rocker.  "I have been sat on long enough!
I am never coming back!"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I said when I galloped
away," sighed the old stove.  "But, after
all, I was glad to come back.  Perhaps
you will be the same."
</p>

<p>
"No!  Never!" said the brown rocker
proudly.  "When I run away, I go for
good!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, watch your chance," went on
the stove, "and when no one is looking,
slip out the back door and run away.  Or,
since you have rockers on your legs, I
suppose you will have to rock away."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed the chair, "I am a traveling
rocker and I am going off to have
adventures."
</p>

<p>
He looked out in the yard.  Lizzie, the
maid, was no longer there hanging out the
clothes.  Racky could hear her moving
about down in the laundry.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the chair could hear
Grandma talking in the front hall to
Mrs. Trent.  The mother of Nat and Weezie
had also come down stairs to get the letter
which her neighbor brought over.
</p>

<p>
"I believe I'll never get a better chance
than this!" suddenly thought Racky.
"There is no one in the kitchen to stop
me, and I can rock right out the back
door, across the yard, now that Lizzie isn't
there, and through the hole in the fence.
Then I'll start traveling over the vacant
lots to have adventures.  I'm going now!"
</p>

<p>
Racky wished he might call good-bye to
Gassy down in the laundry, but, with
Lizzie now there, this was out of the
question.  The stove and chair did not want to
let the people of the house know that they
could talk among themselves.
</p>

<p>
So Racky could only softly whisper:
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Gassy!  I'm going to run
away!  I'll never see you again, nor hear
your voice, for I am never coming back!
I am not going to stay here to be sat on
by a fat old lady whose weight makes me
creak and groan.  I am going off by
myself to have jolly adventures and lots of
fun.  Good-bye, Gassy!"
</p>

<p>
The stove could not hear this whisper,
and so did not answer.  But over his head
Gassy could hear Racky rocking away on
the kitchen linoleum.
</p>

<p>
"I believe that rocker is really getting
ready to run away!" thought Gassy as he
watched Lizzie wring more clothes out of
the blue water so she could hang them in
the yard.  "I hope he doesn't get caught,"
mused the gas stove.
</p>

<p>
And run away was just what the chair
intended to do.  He had chosen a good
time, too, with Grandma out in the hall
and Lizzie down in the laundry.  The
back kitchen door was open, because the
room was so hot from the cake-baking.
Grandma had opened the door herself.
</p>

<p>
"Here's where I go!" whispered Racky,
and he began to rock very hard, for it was
by swaying to and fro that he traveled
along sideways, as well as ahead.
</p>

<p>
Over the kitchen floor he rocked his
way, and the cushions were so well tied
in the chair that they did not fall out.
And Grandma's glasses were tucked down
so deeply among the cushions that they
did not bounce out.
</p>

<p>
Racky reached the door, rocked out on
the small, back porch and hesitated a
moment at the top step.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've got to get down them some
way," he said to himself.  "I may tumble
and break a leg, but I'll have all four
legs broken, and my rockers, too, if I stay
here to be sat on by fat Grandma.  She
is jolly enough, and means well, but she is
too heavy for me!"
</p>

<p>
So, all of a sudden, giving himself
another swaying rock, Racky went sliding
down the back steps, making quite a
noise.
</p>

<p>
"There he goes!" whispered the gas
stove down in the cellar.  "Racky is
going adventuring!  I wish him luck!"
</p>

<p>
Lizzie, wringing out the clothes, also
heard the sliding, thumping, bumping
noise up at the back door.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Baker!" called the maid,
"We want one loaf of bread to-day!"
</p>

<p>
But there was no answer.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't the baker," said Lizzie as
she went on wringing out the clothes from
the blue water.  "I guess it was the
children.  But no&mdash;it couldn't have been
them, either," she said, musingly, "they
are at school.  It must have been that dog
Thump.  Yes, that's who it was&mdash;that dog
Thump."
</p>

<p>
But it wasn't Thump, as we know.  It
was Racky the rocker, running away.
</p>

<p>
And, having safely reached the ground
at the foot of the kitchen steps, without
breaking any of its legs, the chair began
to sway to and fro so as to travel across
the yard, toward the back fence, where
there was a large hole.
</p>

<p>
Rodney and Nat had made this hole by
taking off some of the boards.  The boys
found it quicker to get into the back lots
through the hole in the fence than by
going around the corner of the street.
</p>

<p>
"And I'm glad they left the boards off,"
said Racky.  "I can get out that way.
Once in the open lots, I'll go so fast they
shall never catch me to bring me back.
</p>

<p>
"I hope no one in the houses next door,
on either side, sees me," thought Racky.
"If they do, they may call to Grandma
and she will come out and bring me in."
</p>

<p>
But the only person who saw Racky in
the yard was Dabby, the cook in the Trent
house, next door, where Rodney and
Addie lived.  And Dabby caught a glimpse
of the rocker between the sheets on the
line.  She knew the old chair belonged to
Grandma Harden.
</p>

<p>
"I guess they've been cleaning the chair
cushions with gasoline," thought Dabby,
"and they put them out in the yard to
air."
</p>

<p>
Dabby only had a fleeting glimpse of
the rocking chair between the flapping
clothes.  If she had thought it was
running away of course she would have given
an alarm, and perhaps have hurried out
to stop it.  But she did not give it much
thought because, a moment later, the
telephone bell rang, and Dabby hastened out
of the kitchen to answer it.
</p>

<p>
So it happened that no one really saw
the rocking chair get through the hole in
the fence, which trick Racky did a few
minutes later.  It was hard work for the
chair to escape from the yard.  If it had
been a kitchen chair, with legs that had no
curved rockers fast to them, it would have
been easier.
</p>

<p>
"But one can never succeed unless he
tries," said Racky to himself.  "And I
am going to try very hard!"
</p>

<p>
So he rocked and swayed to and fro,
straining at his legs and reaching out with
his arms&mdash;oh, yes! the rocking chair had
arms, of course&mdash;and at last he was
through the hole in the fence.
</p>

<p>
"I am free at last!  Free!" exclaimed
Racky in his own kind of a voice&mdash;a sort
of squeak, peculiar to some rocking chairs.
"I am free!  No more shall I be sat on by
fat, old ladies, though I really love
Grandma Marden.  But I cannot stand it
to be cracked apart and then stuck up in
the attic with the junk.  I am running
away at last!"
</p>

<p>
The chair was now in the open lots
back of the two houses in which the four
children lived.  All about were dried
weeds growing, for summer had passed, it
was now late fall, and, as Weezie had
said, it would soon be Christmas, or at
least Thanksgiving, and we all know
Christmas comes after the turkey holiday.
</p>

<p>
"How wonderful it is to be free&mdash;to
do as one pleases!" cried Racky, with a
happy little laugh.  "I wonder what
adventure I shall have first?"
</p>

<p>
As he rocked along, something rattled
beneath his seat cushion.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" cried the chair in surprise,
stopping short, "is one of my legs coming
loose?"
</p>

<p>
He felt about with his arms and was
glad to find that all four legs were still
firmly in place, as were the two rockers.
Then Racky felt beneath the cushion and
found Grandma's glasses.
</p>

<p>
"She left them with me when she went
to ask about the chocolate," murmured
Racky.  "Well, I can't take them back,
for if I did I might not get another chance
to run away.  I don't want to leave them
here in the lots, either, for it will snow,
soon, and they will be covered up.  I guess
I shall have to take Grandma's glasses
with me!"
</p>

<p>
Starting to rock again, Racky moved
on and on over the lots, through patch
after patch of dried weeds which tickled
his legs and made him laugh in glee.  For
he was very happy because he was
running away.
</p>

<p>
"Ho, for the jolly adventures!" sang
Racky to himself.
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden, from a patch of weeds
at his right arm, there came a strange
sound.  The weeds shivered and shook,
though there was no wind to cause them to
do this.
</p>

<p>
"Something is coming!" whispered
Racky to himself, stopping short.  "I
wonder if it is Grandma chasing after
me, to make me go back, or if it is an
adventure I am about to have?  I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
The noise grew louder and the weeds
shook harder.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
ADVENTURE III
<br><br>
EXCITEMENT IN THE HOUSE
</h3>

<p>
Racky stood still in the middle of the
lot, his four legs held stiffly under him and
his arms rigid at his sides.
</p>

<p>
What was going to happen?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, out of the tangle of frost-killed
weeds rushed&mdash;Thump, the shaggy
dog belonging to Rodney Trent&mdash;belonging,
also, to his sister Addie; and to Nat
and Weezie next door.  The dog belonged
to all four children, equally, though, in
the beginning, Mr. Trent had bought the
puppy for Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's you; is it, Thump?" asked
Racky in a low voice, for the chair, the
stove and the dog could talk to, and
understand, each other.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is I," barked Thump, who, at
times, was very careful about grammar,
for once he had been to school, as I have
told you.  "But what in the world are you
doing out here, Racky?" asked the dog.
</p>

<p>
Racky looked carefully around, before
answering, to make sure neither Grandma
nor Lizzie was coming after him.  Then,
rocking a bit closer to Thump, who stood
in the patch of weeds, with his head thrust
out, the chair whispered:
</p>

<p>
"I am running away!"
</p>

<p>
"Running away!" barked Thump.
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  I can't stand Grandma's treatment
any longer."
</p>

<p>
"Did she scratch you, or stick pins in
you, or pull your tail?" whined Thump.
"No, she couldn't pull your tail," he made
haste to add, "for you haven't any.  But
what did she do to you to make you want
to run away?"
</p>

<p>
"She sits on me too hard!" answered
the chair.  "Poor Grandma&mdash;it isn't all
her fault," added Racky with a sigh, "it's
just because she is getting too heavy and
fat!  It's too bad, for otherwise, she is
such a jolly old lady.  And I'm sorry about
her glasses, too!  But I am going to run
away!  I have already started."
</p>

<p>
"So I see," barked the dog, coming out
of the weeds and walking around the
chair.  "You are on your way.  But what
do you mean about Grandma's glasses?"
</p>

<p>
"She left them in between my
cushions," answered the chair.  "I didn't
dare go back with them, and I don't want
to leave them in the lot for it may snow.
Will you take them back to her?"
</p>

<p>
Thump thought this over for a moment.
He was very fond of Grandma Harden,
for she had given him many a juicy bone.
He would have been glad to do her the
favor of returning her glasses, but, all of
a sudden, Thump stiffened his tail and
barked:
</p>

<p>
"No!  I am going to run away myself!"
</p>

<p>
"You are?" cried Racky.  "When,
where and with whom?"
</p>

<p>
"I am going to run away now&mdash;with
you!" barked the dog.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, good!" exclaimed the rocking
chair.  "I thought I would have to go
alone, by myself.  It will be much more
jolly to have company.  We can have
many adventures, and talk about them.
First," he went on with a little laugh,
"when I heard that noise, and saw the
weeds moving, I thought an adventure
was coming out.  But it was only you,
Thump."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have been roaming around in
these weeds looking for a bone I buried
last week," said Thump.  "But I can't
seem to remember where I hid it.  Yes,
I guess I'll run away myself!  Rod
wouldn't let me come with him this morning.
I'll show him I don't have to stay
home unless I want to!  I'm going to run
away!"
</p>

<p>
"You know all about it; don't you?"
asked the chair, who felt a bit envious of
the dog.  "You have run away before."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," answered Thump, as though
running away was an old story with him.
"I went off with Gassy when he ran
away.  We had good times together!"
</p>

<p>
"And now you're coming with me!"
murmured the rocking chair.  "How fine
that will be!  What jolly adventures we
shall have!"  And he laughed until he
nearly tumbled over backward.
</p>

<p>
"Come on then," barked Thump.  "We
had better get as far off as we can before
they start to chase us, as they may.  Did
anyone see you come away?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Racky.  "Grandma
was out in the hall, and Lizzie went into
the laundry from the yard, just as I slid
out the back door.  No one saw me leave."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" barked Thump.  "It will be
all the mysteriouser."
</p>

<p>
"What's mysteriouser?" asked Racky.
</p>

<p>
"It means strange," explained Thump,
who was a bit proud that he had once
been in school, though he didn't stay long.
</p>

<p>
"Then why don't you say strange?"
asked Racky.
</p>

<p>
"Because mysteriouser is a much more
stylisher word," answered the dog.  "But
let's start running away some more.  It's
a good thing none of them saw you leave!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed!" agreed Racky, and he
began to sway again, following Thump
across the lots, for the dog, having no
rockers on his legs, could go a bit faster
than the chair.
</p>

<p>
But if no one saw Racky leave the house,
his absence was soon found out, or
discovered, as Thump might have said.  For
Grandma came back in from the hall to
mix the chocolate to put on the cake, and
when she did not see the rocking chair
where she had left it, with her basket of
mended stockings on the floor beside it,
the old lady cried out:
</p>

<p>
"Why, my goodness!"
</p>

<p>
"Is the cake burned?" asked Nat's
mother, who was on her way back up
stairs.
</p>

<p>
"No, the cake isn't burned," answered
Grandma.  "I took it out of the oven
before I went to ask you where the
chocolate was.  But my rocking chair is gone!"
</p>

<p>
"Your what?" asked Mother Harden.
</p>

<p>
"Racky&mdash;my traveling rocker," went
on Grandma.  "I brought it out to the
kitchen to sit in, while I darned the
stockings and watched to see that the cake
didn't burn, but now it is gone!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is that all?" laughed her
daughter-in-law.  "I thought something had
happened."  And there really had, as was
soon found out.  "I suppose," went on
Nat's mother, "that Lizzie thought you
were through with your rocker and has
carried it into the living room, where you
nearly always sit in it.  Lizzie must have
taken it."
</p>

<p>
"What did I take?" asked Lizzie, coming
up, just then, from the laundry, in
time to hear this last talk.  "What did I
take, Mrs. Marden?"
</p>

<p>
"Grandma's rocker," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
"I had it here in the kitchen, to sit in
while I watched the cake baking, and
mended the children's stockings," added
the dear, fat, old lady.  "Did you carry it
out, Lizzie!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, no ma'am, Mrs. Marden, I
didn't touch your chair," was the quick
answer.  "I've been down in the laundry,
almost all the time, excepting when I was
in the yard hanging out the clothes.  I
didn't even know you had brought your
chair to the kitchen."
</p>

<p>
"It's very queer," said Grandma,
looking about.  "And my glasses are gone,
too!" she added, as she put her hands
to the top of her head where, sometimes,
she pushed back her "other eyes," as
Weezie used to call them.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you leave your glasses'?"
asked Mother Marden.
</p>

<p>
"In the cushions of the chair.  I slipped
them off to go ask you about the chocolate.
And now the chair is gone and my
glasses are with it.  Dear me!  It is very
strange!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, nothing could have happened,"
declared the mother of Nat and Weezie.
"If Lizzie didn't take the chair, some
one else did."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't, and I don't believe you did,"
said Grandma, looking at her daughter-in-law.
"And Racky certainly couldn't
have rocked off by himself, I'm sure!"
</p>

<p>
"What about the gas stove?" asked
Lizzie quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" exclaimed old Mrs. Marden.
</p>

<p>
"I say what about the gas stove?"
repeated Lizzie.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever does the girl mean?" asked
Grandma in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"It was before you came to live with
us," went on the maid.  "Mr. Marden
ordered a new gas stove.  Mr. Zink, the
plumber, loosened the pipes on the old
stove.  And when he went away to get the
new one, the old stove ran away, all by
itself, it really did!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what utter nonsense!  A fairy
story!" laughed Grandma.  "I suppose
a junk man came and carried off the old
gas stove, and the children pretended that
it had gone off by itself to have adventures;
wasn't that it, Helen?" she asked
the mother of Weezie.
</p>

<p>
"Well," was the slow answer, "the gas
stove certainly disappeared.  The children
declared they found it in the woods,
several miles from here.  But their father
insisted the junk man must have taken it
away by mistake, and that it fell out of
his wagon in the woods."
</p>

<p>
"No, it didn't!" declared Lizzie, firmly
but with the respect due to her mistress.
"That gas stove ran away by itself.  And
it came home on the back of an elephant,
with Thump and the children; didn't it?"
she asked.  "You can't deny that,
Mrs. Marden.  The stove came back on an
elephant!"
</p>

<p>
"Did it, really!" asked Grandma.  "I
have heard the children talk about such a
happening, but I supposed they were
making it up."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Mother Marden, as if she
did not like to admit it but was obliged
to, "the old gas stove certainly came home
on an elephant's back."
</p>

<p>
"But how in the world&mdash;?" began Grandma.
</p>

<p>
"It was a trained elephant, that had
escaped from the circus," said the
children's mother.  "And it picked up our
boy and girl, and Rodney and Addie, as
well as Thump the dog and the gas stove."
</p>

<p>
"Really!" exclaimed Grandma.  "That
is quite strange, of course, but it's very
natural.  I can understand how that
happened.  But this is something different.
My glasses have vanished, and my rocking
chair has gone away, but I'm sure it
didn't run off by itself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes it did!" declared Lizzie, but in
a low voice, so neither of the ladies would
hear her.  "That rocker ran off by itself,
you'll find!  Something happened to hurt
its feelings, just as happened to the old
gas stove.  This is a very queer house,"
she went on, shaking her head as she went
down into the laundry again.  "A very
queer house!  Strange things happen
here!  I wouldn't be surprised to see the
piano go flying out of the window some
day, or the old couch walk off the front
porch!  No, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
But Grandma was sure Lizzie had carried
the rocker out of the kitchen, and
had forgotten about it, or else that Mother
Marden had done so.
</p>

<p>
"But I tell you I wasn't in the kitchen
this morning until just now, Mother!"
said young Mrs. Marden.  "You must
have taken the chair and carried it out
yourself!"
</p>

<p>
"No!" said the old lady.  "But we'll
look around and find it!"
</p>

<p>
However this was more easily said than
done, and, though soon an excited search
was being made, the old rocker could not
be found.  It was neither down cellar, up
stairs nor in the attic.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!  What could have become
of it, and my glasses?" exclaimed
Grandma.
</p>

<p>
"It walked away, I tell you!" insisted
Lizzie.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" cried Grandma, and the
children's mother said the same.
</p>

<p>
"There must have been some one in
the house," went on the old lady.
"Perhaps a tramp came in and carried the
rocker away."
</p>

<p>
Just then there was a noise on the rear
porch, and Lizzie cried:
</p>

<p>
"Maybe that's a tramp now!"
</p>

<p>
But when, still more excited, the three
of them hurried to the back door, they
only saw Nat and Weezie coming home
from school for their noon lunch.
</p>

<p>
"Where's the surprise, Grandma?"
asked the little girl.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a chocolate cake?" shouted Nat.
Then, all at once, the children knew that
something very strange had happened.
They could tell this by the looks on the
faces of their mother, their grandma and
Lizzie.
</p>

<p>
"Nat, run down to the corner, and
bring back Policeman Paddock!" said
Grandma, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"A policeman&mdash;what for?" gasped Weezie.
</p>

<p>
"A tramp has taken my rocking chair
and my glasses!" said Grandma, sternly.
"I want the policeman to chase after him
and get them back!  Hurry, or it may be
too late!"
</p>

<p>
But before Nat could hasten down to
the corner, up the front steps came big
Policeman Paddock himself, swinging his
club.
</p>

<p>
"There's something the matter in the
lot back of your house, Mrs. Marden,"
said the officer to the children's mother.
"There's a great commotion in the weeds,
and I hear a dog barking!  Don't be
frightened but I'll just go through your
kitchen and over your back fence and see
what it's all about!"
</p>

<p>
The policeman started to run through
the house, while Weezie and Nat looked
at each other with wonder in their eyes.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
ADVENTURE IV
<br><br>
SLIDING DOWN HILL
</h3>

<p>
Not for long, though, did Nat and Weezie
stand there.  It was all so exciting&mdash;so
thrilling!  The idea of having a policeman
come in your house, to rush out toward
the back lots where something was
happening!  Nat and Weezie had never
known anything like this.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" called the little boy to his
sister.  "Let's go see what it is!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think it will hurt us?" asked
Weezie, holding back a little.
</p>

<p>
"No!" answered her brother.  "Anyhow,
isn't Policeman Paddock here with
his club?  And Mother and Grandma
have gone out to see about it!"
</p>

<p>
This gave Weezie courage, so she followed
the officer out into the yard, close
after Nat.  The children saw the policeman
crawling through the hole in the
back fence&mdash;the same hole through which
Racky the rocker had gone but a little
while before.  Only they did not know this.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Nat?" asked Rodney,
looking over the side fence.
</p>

<p>
"Is somebody going to be arrested?"
asked Addie.
</p>

<p>
She and her brother had come home
from school to eat their lunch, just as had
Nat and Weezie.  They had heard the
loud talk in the house next door, and had
seen the blue-coated officer run out of the
back door with his swinging club.
</p>

<p>
"Is somebody going to be arrested!"
Addie again inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't guess so," answered
Weezie.  "Anyhow, it's only a tramp."
</p>

<p>
"A tramp came in while we were at
school," explained Nat, "and took Grandma's
rocking chair and her glasses.  She
sent me after a policeman, but he came in,
anyhow, before I could run after him!"
</p>

<p>
"He said the tramp was in the lots back
of our house," added Weezie, "and I guess
he's going to arrest him."
</p>

<p>
"No, he didn't say there was a <i>tramp</i>
there," corrected Nat, "but he said there
was a lot of scrabbling around in the tall
weeds, and he heard a dog bark."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe it's Thump," suggested Rodney
as he and his sister jumped down off
the boxes upon which they had climbed, to
look over the side fence, and ran toward
the back.  Their fence also had a hole in
it through which they could crawl to the
vacant lots.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is Thump!" went on Rodney
as the children hurried to the clump of
tall, dried weeds, around which now stood
the policeman and the mother and
grandmother of Nat and Weezie.  "It is
Thump!  There he comes!"
</p>

<p>
And, surely enough, out of the weeds
ran the dog, barking and wagging his
tail.  He seemed much excited over something.
</p>

<p>
"Is the tramp there?" called Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Did you arrest him!" Rodney wanted
to know.
</p>

<p>
"Are Grandma's chair and glasses
there?" was the question Weezie asked,
while Addie called to Thump:
</p>

<p>
"Be still!  Stop barking!"
</p>

<p>
"No, children," said Mother Harden,
"there isn't any tramp here, nor anything
else.  And the rocking chair isn't
here&mdash;how could it be?"
</p>

<p>
"It could be if it ran away like our
gas stove did," said Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  Ha!" laughed Policeman Paddock.
"Who ever heard of a gas stove
running away?"
</p>

<p>
"Ours did," said Weezie, but the
policeman did not hear her, or, if he did,
he paid no attention, for he was playing
with Thump, letting the dog catch hold
of the leather thong on the club.
</p>

<p>
"I guess it was a false alarm," went on
the officer as he started back toward the
fence.  "I was walking along," he
explained, "and I looked through, between
the houses, and saw something moving in
the tall weeds.  Then I heard a dog
barking and I thought something had
happened.  But it hadn't."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, something happened," said
Grandma Harden.  "A tramp got in our
house, while I was baking a cake, and
stole my rocking chair and my glasses!"
</p>

<p>
"Stole a rocking chair!" cried the
officer.  "That's a queer thing for a tramp
to take!  And glasses, too&mdash;that's stranger
still!"
</p>

<p>
"My glasses were in the chair
cushions," explained Grandma.  "And
what I am going to do without them I
don't know!  I can't see to read, sew or
bake.  You'll have to finish chocolate-frosting
that cake, Helen," she told Nat's
mother.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll do that," young Mrs. Harden
promised.  "But it is very strange about
that chair.  We were just sending for
you, Mr. Paddock, to ask if you had seen
any tramps about, when you came running in."
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't seen any tramps," said
the policeman, "but I'll be on the lookout
for any of the ragged chaps who have your
chair and glasses," he told Grandma.
"I'll be watching for them!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope you catch them," exclaimed the
old Mrs. Marden.
</p>

<p>
By this time the two ladies, and the
policeman, had made their way back
through the hole in the Marden fence, the
officer to go out on the streets, up and
down which he marched all day, keeping
order.  And Mrs. Marden wanted to get
the children's lunch.
</p>

<p>
As for the two boys and the two girls,
they lingered about the clump of weeds,
near which Thump also stood, his head
cocked on one side and his ears held up.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Thump could tell a strange story
had he wished!
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what Thump saw here that
made him bark so hard?" asked Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe a strange cat," answered Rod.
"Or maybe a big rat."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;a rat!  I'm going in!" cried
Weezie, making a dash for the fence.
</p>

<p>
"So am I!" echoed Addie, so the two
boys were left there with Thump.
</p>

<p>
"Ho!  Ho!" laughed Nat.  "Rats won't
hurt you!"
</p>

<p>
"Not with Thump around," declared
Rod.  "Look!" he called to his chum,
"see how the weeds are all trampled down,
as if there had been a fight here."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe Thump was fighting another
dog," suggested Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe," agreed Rod.  "And look at
these two funny marks in the soft ground,
as if somebody had dragged a sled along."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody would drag a sled now,"
objected Nat.  "There's no snow on the
ground, but maybe it will snow soon, for
it's getting colder."
</p>

<p>
"Those are funny marks," went on
Rod.  "I wonder what made them?"
</p>

<p>
But Nat could not tell, though, soon
after that, he remembered and then
something very strange happened.
</p>

<p>
Thump sniffed about in the weeds, he
sniffed at the queer marks in the soft
ground.  Then the boys' mothers called
them to lunch.
</p>

<p>
"I could tell what those marks are if
I wanted to," laughed Thump to himself
as he followed his little master into the
yard.  For the dog could understand boy
and girl talk, though he could not speak
that language.  Thump talked by barks,
whines and by wags of his tail.
</p>

<p>
True it was that Thump could have told
about the queer marks had he wished, for
they were made by the runaway rocking
chair.  After Racky had told the dog he
was going away, and after Thump said
he, too, would go, all of a sudden Thump
remembered something, and turned back.
</p>

<p>
"I can't go with you, Racky," barked
the dog, as the old, brown chair started
to sway away.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Racky.  "I thought
you said Rodney didn't treat you kindly&mdash;that
he wouldn't let you come with him
to-day&mdash;and that you would be glad to
run away again, as you did with my friend
the gas stove."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I said that," softly barked
Thump, "but I just happened to remember
that Rod and Nat are going fishing
to-morrow, or maybe this afternoon, and
they are going to take me with them.  I
love to go fishing with the boys, so I guess
I won't run away this time."
</p>

<p>
"All right," spoke the rocking chair,
"then I'll have to run away alone.  But
don't tell anybody which way I went,
Thump."
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't tell," promised the dog
and then, all of a sudden, he grew much
excited and whispered: "Quick, Racky,
rock away as fast as you can!  I see a
policeman passing along the street between
my house and your house.  Maybe he is
coming after you!  Rock away!  I'll chase
my tail here in the weeds and bark loud,
and the policeman will look at me and he
won't see you.  That will give you a
chance to rock away and hide!  Quick!
Go on!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-064"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-064.jpg" alt="&quot;QUICK, RACKY, ROCK AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!&quot;">
<br>
&quot;QUICK, RACKY, ROCK AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!  I will!" said the chair.  So
away he rocked through the stiff weeds
and bushes, off toward the forest and the
lake.
</p>

<p>
Now Policeman Paddock, though he
had been seen by Thump passing along
the street, had no notion of coming after
the rocking chair.  He did not even know
Racky was running away.  But Thump
thought he did, and the dog began making
a great fuss so the officer would look at
him and not try to stop Racky.
</p>

<p>
And, surely enough, hearing the noise
in the weeds, Policeman Paddock came
rushing in, as I have told you, but all he
saw was a dog.  By this time Racky had
rocked far enough away to be out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad they didn't catch me!" murmured
the chair to himself as he traveled
on over the vacant lots.  "If it hadn't
been for Thump, though, my adventures
would be at an end before they had fairly
begun.
</p>

<p>
"But now I am off to see the world!
No more fat old ladies, however nice they
are, can sit on me, making me creak and
groan.  I am going to do as I please!"
</p>

<p>
So, holding his arms stiffly against his
sides, and settling his cushions down in his
seat and against his back, away rocked
Racky.  It was getting colder, though
the sun was shining brightly, and at first
the chair, who had lived, all his life, in a
warm house, felt a bit chilly.
</p>

<p>
"But if I rock faster, perhaps I will
get warm," he told himself, so he swayed
to and fro as hard as he could.  And the
more he rocked the farther on he traveled,
for that is the way of some rocking chairs.
Soon he felt a warm glow all through his
legs and arms.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I ought to begin my adventures
very soon," thought Racky as he rocked
over the fields toward the woods.  "I
wonder what will be the first one?"
</p>

<p>
And, almost before he knew it, an
adventure happened to him.
</p>

<p>
He was swaying along, not thinking of
any danger when, all of a sudden, he
found himself on top of a rather steep
little hill, which led down to the edge of
a wide brook.  The hill was covered with
grass, which was now dried because Jack
Frost had touched it with his cold fingers;
and this grass was slippery.
</p>

<p>
All at once, Racky rocked himself up
to the top of this hill, and, before he could
stop himself, he began sliding swiftly
down.  Faster and faster his smooth,
polished rockers slipped along the crisp
grass as a boy coasts down a snow-covered
hill on his sled.  Faster and faster slid
Racky.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wonder what will happen to
me?" thought the chair.  "This is
certainly an adventure.  But it will not be
a very jolly one if I splash into that brook
at the foot of the hill!  Oh, dear!  I can't
stop myself!"
</p>

<p>
And straight on toward the brook slid
Racky!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
ADVENTURE V
<br><br>
THE SINGING GIRL
</h3>

<p>
Amid a clearing in the forest, and not
far from the edge of the brook, stood a
little cottage where lived the Singing
Girl.  She was the daughter of a
wood-chopper who, every morning, tramped
off through the lanes of tall trees to cut
fire-sticks which he sold in the town.  The
Singing Girl, as she was called, remained
at home in the cottage, after her father
had gone to cut wood.  She washed the
dishes, she swept the floors and she dusted
the furniture until her father came home
at night, when she would have his supper
ready.
</p>

<p>
As she worked about the cottage, the
Girl sang&mdash;jolly little songs she would
sing, about anything and everything, for
she was very happy, though she and her
father were poor.
</p>

<p>
"La, la, la!" the Girl would sing.
"Tra, la, la!"  Just simple little things
like that.
</p>

<p>
"My Singing Girl is happy!" the wood-chopper
would say as he tramped off in
the forest.
</p>

<p>
Now it was toward this cottage of the
Singing Girl that Racky, the runaway
rocker, was sliding as he coasted down
the grassy hill, at the foot of which was
the wood-chopper's home.
</p>

<p>
Faster and faster down the slope glided
the rocking chair.  He could see the
water of the brook sparkling in the sun.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do?  How can I stop
myself from sliding into the brook and
drowning?" thought the chair.  He did
not dream that, being made of wood, he
would float like a cork, and not sink.  "I
didn't know adventures were like this&mdash;so
dangerous!" murmured Racky, shivering,
for the warm glow had left him.  "I
wonder what Gassy would do if he were
here?"
</p>

<p>
But the stove was not there to ask, so
Racky just had to keep on sliding.  He
was close to the brook now.  Another
second or two and he would splash in.
But just then the Singing Girl ran out of
the cottage humming:
</p>

<p>
"La!  La!  La, la, la!"
</p>

<p>
She had finished washing the dishes,
and was bringing out the drying-towels
to hang on a bush in the sun when, looking
up the hill, she saw the rocking chair
coming down.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, isn't that wonderful!" laughed
the Singing Girl.  "A chair sliding down
hill!  I never saw such a thing before.
Never!  Never!  Never!  Turoo!  Turoo!
Turoo!" she sang merrily.
</p>

<p>
"It would be much better if you would
stop your singing, sweet as it sounds, and
save me from going into the brook,"
thought Racky, though, of course, he said
nothing that the Girl could understand.
"Save me!  Save me!" begged the chair,
in his own, queer talk.  "I ran away to
have adventures, but I don't want to be
drowned!  Save me!"
</p>

<p>
And then, just as if the Singing Girl
had heard, and understood, she ran out
until she stood in front of the sliding
rocker.  With a quick motion, like a
cowboy with a lasso, the Girl flung her
drying-towel around the top of the chair's
back, and there she held him firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Whoa there, you funny sliding-down-hill
rocker!" laughed the Singing Girl.
"Whoa there, my pony chair!  I caught
you just in time!"
</p>

<p>
And, surely enough, that is just what
she had done.  For, in another second or
two, Racky would have been in the brook,
so slippery was the grassy hill and so
shiny were his rockers.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," said the Singing Girl,
looking up the slope, "are there any more
pieces of furniture coming down?  If
there are I'll be ready for them."
</p>

<p>
"No, I am the only one,"  said Racky.
"I ran away all by myself because I got
sat on so hard.  Thump, the dog, started
to run away with me, but he turned back
to go fishing with the boys.  Maybe he'll
come along later.  But there is no more
furniture!"
</p>

<p>
Of course the Singing Girl could not
understand what Racky said.  To her it
sounded only like squeaks, creaks and
snaps, such as you may often hear in a
chair when you sit on it.  That is the
time when chairs, couches, tables, stools
and other things speak to you; only it
isn't everyone who knows what they say.
</p>

<p>
But the Singing Girl, after standing
and looking up the hill a little while
longer, could see no more furniture coming
down, so she took the lasso-towel off
the back of Racky and, humming another
jolly little song, she carried the chair into
the cottage.
</p>

<p>
"I could rock myself in there alone if
she would let me," said the chair.  "I
don't need to be carried.  But go ahead,
if you like."
</p>

<p>
Racky had made up his mind to stay in
the cottage over night.  His slide down
the grassy hill, and his narrow escape
from splashing into the brook, had made
the runaway rocker a bit nervous.
</p>

<p>
"I'll stay here to-night," he said to
himself, "and in the morning, as soon as
I get a chance to slip away, I'll travel
on."
</p>

<p>
But of course the Singing Girl knew
nothing of this.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are a nice, old-fashioned
rocker!" she said as she looked at the
chair and hummed a little tune.  "We
have no rocker in our cottage, and when
Father comes home from chopping wood
he will be glad to sit himself down and
rest on your cushions.  They look very
soft!"
</p>

<p>
With that the Girl seated herself in the
old, brown rocker and began swaying to
and fro, singing: "La!  La!  La!"
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!  I hope she doesn't break
Grandma's glasses!" thought Racky, for
he could feel the spectacles in between his
seat and back cushions.  "The old lady
sat on me hard, it is true, but I wouldn't
like her glasses to be smashed!"
</p>

<p>
Racky wished he could speak the talk
of real people, that he might call out a
warning to the Singing Girl, but he could
not say a word.  However he creaked and
squeaked and rattled as best he could,
hoping, in that way, to make her more
careful.
</p>

<p>
But she only laughed as she rocked to
and fro, saying:
</p>

<p>
"My, but you are an old chair!  You
must have come out of Noah's Ark, by
the way you creak!  And you are a
traveling chair, too!" went on the Singing
Girl, for she noticed that, as she rocked,
the chair was sliding over toward the side
of the cottage.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I am a traveling chair!" said
Racky, who could understand what the
Singing Girl was saying, even though he
could not talk to her himself.  "I am
quite a traveler!  Not that I have gone as
far as Gassy, my friend, the stove, in the
laundry, for I have only just started.  I
am a runaway, traveling rocker!  Just
wait!  In the morning you will not find
me here, for I am going to travel on
again."
</p>

<p>
To do that, Racky had made up his
mind.  He was going to rock away in the
night, as soon as he knew the Singing Girl
and her father were asleep.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I must not stay here all day
rocking!" cried the Singing Girl with a
laugh.  "I have my work to do!  But you
are such a nice, easy, old rocker I love to
sit in you!"
</p>

<p>
Up she jumped, but when she looked at
the soft cushions she sat down on them
again with a little bounce.
</p>

<p>
"Easy!  Easy!" cried Racky.  "You'll
break Grandma's glasses!"
</p>

<p>
However, the spectacles were deep
between the cushions, which were quite
thick, and so the glasses came to no harm.
</p>

<p>
Moving the rocker away from the
middle of the cottage floor, the Singing
Girl began to sweep and dust, just as
Racky had often seen Lizzie doing her
work back in the Happy Home he had
left.
</p>

<p>
All day long the Singing Girl worked
about the cottage, and Racky stayed just
where she put him.  For he did not want
to let her know that he could travel by
himself whenever he wished.
</p>

<p>
"But to-night, after dark, I'll slip
away," said Racky to himself.
</p>

<p>
Toward evening the father of the Singing
Girl came home from the forest where
he had chopped wood all day.
</p>

<p>
"Look, Daddy!  See what came to me
while you were away!" cried the Singing
Girl, as she put the supper on the table.
She pointed to the rocker in a corner.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you get that?" asked the
wood-chopper.
</p>

<p>
"It came sliding down the grassy hill!"
</p>

<p>
"Sliding down the grassy hill?  What
do you mean, Singing Girl?  How could
a chair slide down hill?" and the
wood-chopper laughed.
</p>

<p>
"It did look very strange!" said the
Singing Girl.  "I was standing in the
door, going out to hang up my dish-towel,
when I saw the chair coming down.  It
almost slid into the brook, but I lassoed
it."
</p>

<p>
"And very glad I am that you did!"
thought Racky, who was listening.
</p>

<p>
"Clever one!" laughed the wood-chopper
as he kissed the Singing Girl.
"I think I know how the chair came to
be sliding down."
</p>

<p>
"How was it, Daddy?"
</p>

<p>
"A load of moving was going along the
road at the top of the hill.  This rocking
chair fell off and came sliding down.
After a while, when the moving men miss
the chair, they will come back for it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!  That will be too bad!"
sighed the Singing Girl.  "But of course
I will give the chair to whoever comes for
it.  Only I would like to keep it, for it is
so soft to sit in.  And it creaks in the
funniest way.  And, there is something
else, Daddy!" she said with shining eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Singing Girl?" he asked,
as he began to eat his supper.
</p>

<p>
"It is a traveling rocker," she answered
as she laughed like the brook tinkling
over the stones outside the cottage.  "It
moves along over the floor when I rock
in it."
</p>

<p>
"Be careful that it doesn't travel away
before those who lost it from the moving
wagon can come after it," said the wood-chopper.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never fear!  The rocker will stay
here until some one comes for it,"
answered the Singing Girl.
</p>

<p>
"We shall see about that," whispered
Racky to himself.
</p>

<p>
That night the cottage was very still
and quiet.  The wood-chopper and the
Singing Girl were asleep.  They left the
front door open a little way so the black
cat, who lived in the cottage, could go out
and come in.
</p>

<p>
"Now is my chance!" whispered Racky,
as he looked out the partly-open door and
saw the moon shining on the trees.  "I'll
travel on!"
</p>

<h3>
ADVENTURE VI
<br><br>
UP IN THE ATTIC
</h3>

<p>
During the luncheon hour, while Nat
and Weezie were home from school, little
was talked of but the strange disappearance
of the old rocker, with Grandma's
glasses in the cushions.
</p>

<p>
"I can't understand it at all,"
murmured the puzzled old lady who could
hardly see the food on her plate.  "Such
things as rockers being taken away by
tramps never happened in my house!"
</p>

<p>
"This is a different house, Grandma,"
said Nat, "and more different things
happen here than happen in any other house
around&mdash;all the boys say so.  Look how
our gas stove ran away!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't talk to me about such
nonsense!" laughed Grandma.  "You must
have dreamed that about the stove!"
</p>

<p>
But Nat and Weezie were sure they
had not dreamed it.
</p>

<p>
"And I believe your rocker ran away
just the same," said Weezie.
</p>

<p>
But the dear old lady shook her white
head and murmured:
</p>

<p>
"A tramp slipped in and took my chair
and glasses.  However, the police officer
will catch him and bring back Racky,
cushions, glasses and all.  And I'll be so
glad to get them, for I'm half blind as it
is!"
</p>

<p>
When the children hurried back to
school, Rodney and Addie skipping along
with Nat and Weezie, they talked of what
had happened.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't it be great if we could catch
that tramp and get your Grandma's chair
and glasses?" asked Rod, as he and Nat
neared the schoolhouse.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't a tramp, I tell you!" insisted
Nat.  "I know that chair ran away just as
the stove did."
</p>

<p>
"Then why can't we chase after it and
get it back, the same as we did when
Thump ran away, and we found him and
the gas stove together?" asked Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe we could," agreed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let's do it to-morrow, instead of
going fishing!" went on the other boy.
"Will you?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess so&mdash;maybe," agreed Nat.
"To-morrow or next day.  We haven't
any more school this week, on account of
some of the classes having examinations.
So we could go hunting for the chair or
go fishing, whichever we liked."
</p>

<p>
"We can do both!" cried Rod, quickly.
"We'll go fishing and take Thump with
us, and he can help us find the lost
rocker!"
</p>

<p>
"And if we get Grandma's glasses,
maybe she'll give us each five cents,"
exclaimed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Hurray!  That would be great!"
cried Rod, and just then the last bell rang,
so the children had to hurry into school.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon Nat spoke to his mother
about going fishing next day.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it will be too cold,"
objected Mrs. Marden.  "We shall have
winter almost before we know it."
</p>

<p>
"That's why Rod and I want to go
fishing&mdash;before it is too late," explained
Nat.  "Soon the pond and brook will be
frozen over, and then we can't catch
anything.  May we go?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I guess so," promised Mrs. Marden.
"And I hope you catch the big
rocker!"
</p>

<p>
"What?" cried Nat in surprise, looking
at his mother.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I mean I hope you catch the big
fish," she said, laughing a little.  Truth
to tell, she was thinking very much about
the disappearance of the rocker and
grandma's glasses, though she did not
really believe the chair had traveled off
by itself.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have lots of fun!" exclaimed
Nat and he ran to tell his chum that he
could go fishing.  Rod was also permitted
to go, and the two boys made great plans
for next day.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to take Thump?"
asked Weezie of her brother after supper
that evening.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, sure!  Thump's going fishing
with us!"
</p>

<p>
"Then couldn't you take Addie and
me?" begged Weezie.  "We get tired
playing with dolls.  We don't have to
fish&mdash;we could just watch you and Rod."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I guess you can go," promised Nat.
</p>

<p>
But the next day it rained.  It rained
all night.  And it rained the next day,
too.  Big, pelting drops came down, and
when the children looked out of the windows,
they knew there would be no fishing
for them until it cleared.  Two whole
days of rain, and when there was no
school, either!  It was quite sad.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!" sighed Nat when he saw
the second day of rain.
</p>

<p>
"What can we do?" asked his sister.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you play up in the attic?"
inquired Grandma.  "That's what I used
to do when I was a girl, and it rained on
a holiday."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  Let's do that!" exclaimed
Weezie with shining eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If we could have Rod and Addie over,
it would be more fun!" said Nat.
</p>

<p>
A little later, the four children were
up in the big attic of the Happy Home.
On the roof the pelting of the rain drops
sounded more loudly, but Nat and the
others did not mind that, for they were
snug and dry, and in the attic were many
things with which to play.
</p>

<p>
"There's an old rocker in the corner,"
said Rodney, pointing to a dust-covered
one.  "Is it the one named Racky, that
your Grandma uses?  Maybe she doesn't
know it's up here."
</p>

<p>
"No, that's another chair.  It has been
here since before Grandma came to live
with us," explained Nat.  "But I'll pull
it out and we can play it's a steamboat
and take turns having rides.  I'll be a
steamboat engineer!"
</p>

<p>
"And I'll be the captain," offered Rod.
</p>

<p>
"What can we be?" inquired Addie.
</p>

<p>
"We'll be the passengers," suggested
Weezie.  "It's lots of fun to play
steamboat with the old chair."
</p>

<p>
The two boys pulled it out, across the
attic, and, as they did so, Nat pointed to
two long, straight marks the rockers had
made in the dust on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Look!" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what about it?" asked Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean the rocker tracks look
like twin snake marks?" inquired
Weezie.  "They do; don't they?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't mean that," went on
Nat, who had a queer look on his face as
he stared at the dusty trail.  "But don't
you remember&mdash;the clump of weeds where
Thump was barking yesterday?  In the
soft ground, near the weeds, were tracks
just like these we made now, when we
pulled the rocking chair across the floor."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what about that?" asked Rodney again.
</p>

<p>
"Why, don't you see!" went on Nat in
a low voice, just a little bit excited,
"these are the same marks.  There must
have been a rocker pulled along near the
weeds."
</p>

<p>
"But it wasn't this rocker," objected
Weezie.
</p>

<p>
"No, it was Grandma's rocker, I
think!" went on Nat.  "I wondered, when
I saw them, what had made those marks
near the weeds.  Now I know!  It was
Grandma's rocker."
</p>

<p>
"But who would pull her rocker off
across the back lots like that?" Addie
asked.
</p>

<p>
Nat looked carefully around the attic
before answering.  And, when he did, it
was in a whisper.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"Nobody pulled Grandma's rocker
along!  It went there by itself, the same
as our stove did!  The rocker ran away,
and we can tell where it went by following
the tracks it left.  We can get back
Grandma's rocker and glasses.  Come
on!"  His voice was eager and his eyes
were shining bright.
</p>

<p>
"We can't go out in the rain," objected
Weezie.
</p>

<p>
"It's stopped raining now," said Rod,
looking out of the attic window.
</p>

<p>
And so it had.  The early winter storm
was over.  But the sky was still cloudy.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe it will snow!" exclaimed
Addie.
</p>

<p>
"That'll be fun!" came from Weezie.
"I don't mind being out in the snow, but
I don't like to get wet in the rain."
</p>

<p>
"Then let's go out and see if we can
find that runaway rocker!" proposed Nat.
"Mother won't mind.  She wants it to be
found, and so does Grandma.  She needs
her glasses very much."
</p>

<p>
"All right&mdash;we'll go!" decided Rod.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have lots of fun," added his
sister.  "And maybe some adventures
like we did when we went after the gas
stove.  Oh, I'm so glad it stopped raining!"
</p>

<p>
The children hurried down out of the
attic.  They intended to tell Grandma, or
Mother Marden, about what they had
seen&mdash;the two marks in the dusty floor&mdash;marks
that showed where a rocker had
been dragged across&mdash;marks like those in
the soft ground near the weed-clump.
And Nat and Weezie intended to tell their
mother that they were going out to find
Racky and the lost glasses.
</p>

<p>
But when the children came down from
the attic, neither their mother nor
grandmother was to be seen.  The ladies had
gone next door to talk to Mrs. Trent, the
mother of Addie and Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," said Nat, after Lizzie had
told him where his mother was, "she
won't mind if we go out.  Come on!"
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" inquired the
maid.  "You must dress warmly, for it
will be cold after the rain.  Where are
you going?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;just out&mdash;to play," answered
Nat.  He did not want to say they were
going to search for Racky, but that is
just what the children intended to do.
</p>

<p>
"We'll find Grandma's glasses!" declared
Nat as he led the others through
the kitchen into the back yard, where
they could go through the hole in the
fence.

<h3>
ADVENTURE VII
<br><br>
THE SNOW STORM
</h3>

<p>
Now we shall see what happened to
Racky when he slipped out of the cottage
of the Singing Girl into the moonlit
forest.
</p>

<p>
"I hope I don't make a noise and
awaken the wood-chopper," thought the
rocking chair as he softly swayed to and
fro across the floor.  "He would chase
after me and bring me back if he thought
I was going away.  He thinks I dropped
off a load of moving and slid down hill.
But I didn't at all!  I ran away!  I know
what I did."
</p>

<p>
The wood-chopper slept soundly after
his day's work in the forest, and the
Singing Girl did not open her eyes, as Racky
softly slipped through the door.
</p>

<p>
"Now I am out again&mdash;free&mdash;ready for
more adventures," laughed the chair to
himself.  "But I am not going to fall
into you!" he said to the brook which was
murmuring along beneath the trees.
</p>

<p>
"You may splash into me and swim, if
you like," whispered the running brook.
"But my waters are very chilling now,
and you might catch cold."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, then I will stay on dry
land," said the rocking chair.  "I am a
traveler, but not a sailor.  Though back
in Happy Home, where I came from, is
an old sofa who says he is some day going
to sail away to sea."
</p>

<p>
"Is he?" asked the brook.  "Well,
that's wonderful!  You know I, myself,
run down to the great, salty sea."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you?" inquired the rocker.
"I shall tell the sailing sofa about you
when I go back.  But no!  I am never
going back to be sat on by fat old
Grandma!" creaked the rocker.
</p>

<p>
"Is your friend, the sofa, a sailor?"
went on the brook.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he has never yet been to sea,"
Racky replied, "but he is always talking
of going sailing, so I suppose he may,
some day."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him I shall be glad to meet him,"
went on the brook.  "And, if he likes, he
may start his voyaging on my waters."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell him, if ever I go back to
Happy Home," promised the rocker,
"but I think that will never be."
</p>

<p>
This talk was in whispers, for Racky
did not want to awaken the Singing Girl
nor the wood-chopper.  Then, bidding
the brook good-bye, the chair rocked on
and on, traveling through the forest,
which was now white and gleaming under
the silvery moon.
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden, as Racky was swaying
to and fro, his arms held stiffly to his
sides, he heard a voice calling:
</p>

<p>
"Who?  Who?  Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!  That is some one after
me!" thought the rocker.  "Maybe it is
Grandma, or one of the children, or the
policeman whom Thump saw coming.  Or
perhaps it is Thump himself!  I hope
it is!" Then Racky called: "Hello!
Hello!  Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
Down through the trees came the call
again:
</p>

<p>
"Who?  Who?  Who?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" asked Racky.
"Why do you ask who I am, when you
will not tell me who are you?  Who are
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am the owl bird," was the answer.
"I was not asking who you were.  I was
just giving my night call of 'Whoo!
Whoo!  Whoo!'  That was to let my little
owls in the nest know I am coming to
them, soon, with something to eat.  Whoo!
Whoo!  Whoo!"
</p>

<p>
And away flew the owl bird on his big
wings, while Racky, glad to know he was
not being chased by a policeman, traveled
on.  All through the night the chair
rocked away, getting farther and farther
from the Happy Home.
</p>

<p>
At first it was bright moonlight in the
woods, and, though it was cold, Racky
rather liked it.  But soon the moon hid
behind the clouds.  Then it began to rain
and grew very dark.
</p>

<p>
"If this is an adventure, I do not like
it at all!" sighed the runaway rocker.  "I
am going to get all wet and my legs and
arms and joints will creak and squeak
worse than ever.  I wish I could find a
house in which to stay."
</p>

<p>
Almost without knowing it, the chair
was speaking aloud in his own language
and, as he finished, he heard a voice say:
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you come in here?"
</p>

<p>
"In where?" asked Racky, for all he
could see through the trees was a big blob
of darkness, and the voice seemed to come
from this.
</p>

<p>
"Come into this snug, dry cave," was
the answer.  "Then you will be out of the
rain."
</p>

<p>
"Whose cave is it?" asked Racky,
remembering to have heard Gassy tell of
caves, or caverns, that the stove had seen
in the sides of hills when he galloped
away that time.
</p>

<p>
"It is the cave of all the Woodland
Folk," was the answer.  "Any one, who
has no other home, is welcome to live in
this cave as long as he likes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am traveling around, looking
for adventures," said Racky.  "I had a
home, but I left it, so I shall be glad to
come in out of the rain and stay all night.
But who are you, if I may ask?"
</p>

<p>
"You may ask and I shall tell you,"
was the polite answer.  "I am a wild pig
and after my supper of acorns, last night,
I crept into this cave to sleep.  Come in,
you are welcome!"
</p>

<p>
So Racky entered the dark cave in the
side of the hill, beneath the trees from
which dripped the cold rain drops.  At
first the chair could see nothing, but, after
a while, he noticed a little glow, like a
faint fire, in one corner of the cave.  And,
by the glow of this pale fire, the chair
could see the wild pig curled up on a bed
of dried leaves.
</p>

<p>
"That fire looks like the one which
burns in Gassy, when Lizzie is doing the
washing," said Racky, while he gave his
cushions a shake to get the rain out of
them.  As he did so, something fell to the
floor of the cave with a tinkle.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" asked the wild pig,
jumping around.
</p>

<p>
"Grandma's glasses, I guess," said the
chair.  "I hope they aren't broken.  They
were in my cushions when I ran away and
I had no means of sending them back."
</p>

<p>
"No, they aren't broken," said the wild
pig, who could see quite well in the dim
cave.  "Here they are," and he picked
them up and gave them back to Racky,
who tucked them in between the cushions
again.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," creaked the chair.  "But is
some one going to cook a meal, that I see
a fire glowing?"
</p>

<p>
"No, that is fox-fire&mdash;it has no heat,"
explained the wild pig.
</p>

<p>
"Fox-fire?" cried Racky, wonderingly.
"Are there foxes in here, and will they
nibble my legs?  Though my legs are only
wood, I should not like to have them
scratched or nibbled."
</p>

<p>
"Have no fear!" laughed the wild pig.
"It is only called fox-fire because, in the
olden days, foxes were supposed to see
their way about in the forest by its light.
It comes from old, punky, rotten wood
and it only glows as pale and gently as
you see it now.  There is no danger.  The
fox-fire comes from an old rotten stump
that has been in this cave longer than I
can remember.  But, even if a real fox
came in this cave, out of the storm, he
would do you no harm.  We are all friends
here.  Now I am going to sleep again."
</p>

<p>
"And I will sleep, too," said Racky,
who was glad to be in the cave out of
the rain, which was now pattering down
harder than ever.  And so, in the soft
glow of the fox-fire, Racky went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
It was still raining when he awakened
in the morning, and a little daylight
streamed into the cave.  Before the gleam
of the gray dawn the pale fox-fire seemed
to fade away.
</p>

<p>
"But it will glow again when night
comes," said the wild pig.  Then, waddling
over to the rocker, the pig asked:
"Have you a garden rake about you?"
</p>

<p>
"A garden rake?" exclaimed Racky.
"Why, no!  I don't carry rakes!  But
why do you want one?"
</p>

<p>
"To scratch my back," grunted the
pig.  "You know we porkers always like
to have our backs scratched, and I
thought, if you had a rake, you could do it
for me.  But never mind&mdash;it doesn't matter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but it does!" exclaimed Racky.
"I should like to do you a favor since you
were so kind as to invite me into this cave
out of the rain.  And I believe I know
how I can scratch your back."
</p>

<p>
"How can you?" asked the wild pig.
</p>

<p>
"With the sharp ends of my rockers,"
answered the chair.  "Oh, do not be
afraid," he went on with a laugh.  "They
are not sharp enough to cut you.  But if
you will lie down behind me, with your
back toward the ends of my rockers, I will
sway to and fro.  The rocker ends will
move up and down and scratch your
back nicely."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, joy!" grunted the pig.  "I do so
need a back-scratch!"
</p>

<p>
Out he stretched behind the chair, close
to the rocker ends.  To and fro swayed
Racky, and "scritchy-scratchy" went the
somewhat sharp ends on the pig's back.
</p>

<p>
"Uff!  Uff!" grunted the wild porker.
"That feels fine!  It gives me an appetite!
Now I will go out and get a breakfast of
acorns!"
</p>

<p>
"What, in all this rain?" exclaimed Racky.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't mind the rain!" grunted
the pig, and out he waddled.
</p>

<p>
Racky thought he was going to be
lonesome in the cave, after the wild pig had
left, but as the rain kept up, and it grew
lighter in the dim cavern, the chair saw a
small, gray animal come scampering in.
It seemed to be in trouble.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't do it!  I can't do it!"
chattered the small, gray chap.
</p>

<p>
"What can't you do?" asked Racky,
who saw, now, that the animal was a
squirrel.
</p>

<p>
"I can't crack this hard nut!" was the
answer.  "I've tried and I've tried, but
the nut is too hard for me to crack or
gnaw!  You see I am only a this-year's
squirrel," went on the bushy fellow.
"When I grow older, I will know more
about cracking nuts.  But now I am
so hungry, and I can't get at the meat in
this one!  Oh, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll crack the nut for you," said
Racky.
</p>

<p>
"What!  You, a rocking chair, will
crack a nut!  How?" chattered the
squirrel.
</p>

<p>
"Put the nut down on the floor of the
cave," said the chair.  "I will rock over
it and crack the shell for you.  It will be
easy for me, as I am strong."
</p>

<p>
The squirrel placed the nut down on a
low, flat rock.  Racky swayed to and fro,
traveling closer and closer, until one of
the rockers was right over the shell.
Then, suddenly:
</p>

<p>
"Crunch!  Crack!"
</p>

<p>
"There you are&mdash;the nut is broken
open!" cried Racky, and surely enough,
it was.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you!" chattered the gray
squirrel as he began nibbling the sweet
meat and casting aside the bits of broken
shell.
</p>

<p>
Racky cracked several more nuts for
the little chap, who then scampered out
of the cave.  The rocker was wishing the
rain would stop, so he could travel on,
when a white animal, larger than the
squirrel, came hopping in, carrying in
her paws a tiny, furry creature.
</p>

<p>
"Hush now!  Go to sleep.  Rock-a-bye-baby!"
crooned the mother rabbit, for
that is what this new animal was.  "Go
to sleep, my dear!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to go to sleep!  I'm not
sleepy!" whined the baby rabbit.  "I'm
going to stay awake for ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what is mother going to do with
you?" sighed the grown-up rabbit.
"Please go to sleep!"
</p>

<p>
"No!  No!" whined the baby rabbit.
</p>

<p>
Racky felt sorry for the mother bunny,
who looked so tired out and bedraggled
from the rain.
</p>

<p>
"If you will put your little baby girl
rabbit up on my soft cushions I will rock
her to sleep," kindly offered the chair.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is so good of you," said the
mother rabbit.
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not going to sleep!" whined
the cross, peevish little bunny.
</p>

<p>
"We'll see about that, my dear,"
murmured the old, brown chair, who more
than once, when they were small, had
rocked Nat and Weezie to sleep in their
mother's arms.
</p>

<p>
The mother bunny put the little rabbit
up on the chair's soft cushions.  They
were snug and warm, The teeny, weeny
bunny cuddled down as if in a little nest.
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not going to sleep!" she said.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, to and fro, Racky commenced
to sway.  To and fro he rocked, gently,
gently, gently.  The mother bunny
crooned a little song.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not&mdash;going&mdash;not going to&mdash;I'm
not going&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;I'm not&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;going,"
murmured the baby bunny.
</p>

<p>
And then, all of a sudden, she fell
asleep in the rocker.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad," sighed the tired mother
bunny.  Then she, too, cuddled up on
Racky's cushions and went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
It was noon when the little bunny child
awakened, no longer cross or tired after
her slumber.
</p>

<p>
"The rain has stopped," said Mrs. Rabbit.
"Come, Hopper, we shall go out
and get a bit of cabbage to nibble."  And
away they scampered, after thanking
Racky.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if the rain is over," murmured
the chair, which he could see was the case,
by looking out of the cave, "if the rain
is over, I must travel on and find more
adventures.  I haven't had half enough!"
</p>

<p>
Away rocked Racky, away from the
cave, off through the forest.  The rain
had stopped, but it was getting colder.
All of a sudden it began to snow!  The
air was filled with white, swirling flakes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried the runaway rocker, "I
don't like this!  The rain was bad, but
the snow is worse!  What shall I do!  I
must find shelter!"  And off through the
snow-storm rocked the chair as fast as it
could go.
</p>

<p>
"What will happen next?" thought Racky.
</p>

<h3>
ADVENTURE VIII
<br><br>
A LITTLE OLD WOMAN
</h3>

<p>
Racky, the runaway rocker, swayed
out of the cave where he had scratched
the back of the wild pig, where he had
cracked the nut for the squirrel and
where he had rocked the baby rabbit to
sleep.  It was just about the same time
that Nat and the other children started
to search for the missing chair.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do with Racky if we
find him?" asked Weezie of her brother,
as the four slipped through the hole in
the fence and ran across the lots.
</p>

<p>
"Well bring him back to Grandma, of
course," answered Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think her glasses will be
in the chair cushions?" asked Addie.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," was Nat's answer.  "For
without her glasses Grandma can't read
us any stories.  Yes, I think the glasses
will be in the cushions when we find the
chair," he decided.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but don't you remember?" suddenly
called Weezie, as the children hurried
toward the clump of weeds where
they had seen the strange marks.
</p>

<p>
"Don't we remember what?" asked Nat.
</p>

<p>
"About the runaway gas stove," went
on Weezie.  "That had a lot of good
things to eat in the warming oven when
it ran away.  But when we found it in
the woods, and the elephant brought it
home on his back, there wasn't a single
thing left&mdash;<i>not a single thing</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, that was different," said
Nat.  "Hungry people must have eaten
what was in the gas stove&mdash;that was all
right!"
</p>

<p>
"You can't eat glasses!" said Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"That's true!" agreed his chum.  "Nobody
will take Grandma's glasses out of
the chair cushions.  You'll see&mdash;we'll
find them!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope we do," murmured Addie, for
she and her brother loved the dear old
lady, who lived next door to them, almost
as much as did Nat and Weezie.
</p>

<p>
Skipping along over the vacant lots,
still damp and spongy from the rain,
which had only just stopped, the children
soon reached the big clump of weeds
where Nat had noticed the two marks of
the chair's rockers in the soft earth.  The
marks were just like those made when
the old chair in the attic was dragged
through the dust.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe the marks will all be washed
away by the rain," suggested Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"They were deep in the ground," answered
Nat, "and I guess we'll see part
of 'em."  And so it turned out.  On the
edge of the patch of weeds, and straggling
through them, so that some of the
stalks were bent down and broken, were
the tracks made when Racky ran away
from Thump.  Though the rain had
washed away some of the chair's trail,
still it was plain enough for the children
to see.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" cried Nat, joyfully excited.
"The chair was here all right!
Now all we'll have to do will be to follow
these marks and we'll find Racky.  Come on!"
</p>

<p>
He led the way, followed by the others
who were quite as happily excited as he
was.  It would be wonderful to find the
runaway rocker and Grandma's glasses,
the children thought.
</p>

<p>
"How far do you think we'll have to
go!" asked Weezie, when they had followed
the chair's trail quite a distance
over the lot.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not very far, I guess," answered
her brother.  "Why, don't you want to
come?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course I want to come,"
replied Weezie.  "But I don't want to go
too far from home."
</p>

<p>
"I don't, either," said Addie.  "And
it looks like it was going to rain some
more."  She glanced up at the clouds.
</p>

<p>
"I guess it will snow," declared her
brother.  "It's getting colder."
</p>

<p>
"If it snows, it will be lots of fun, and
we can find Racky easier," stated Nat.
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the tracks will be plainer in the
snow," said Nat.  "And we can slide
down hill, too, after we find the chair and
take Grandma's glasses back to her.
Let's run!  I can see where the chair has
been along here," and he pointed to the
marks in the soft ground&mdash;marks that
looked as if a two-wheeled cart had been
hauled along there.  They were the tracks
of Racky's rockers, plain enough.
</p>

<p>
Forward ran the children, laughing
and shouting until, all of a sudden, Addie
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Hark!  Some one is calling us!"
</p>

<p>
They stopped to listen.  They heard a
noise behind them.  Then Rodney began
to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"That's our dog Thump," he said.
"We forgot to take him with us, and he's
following after."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Let him come!" decided Nat.
"He can smell along the track, where it
only shows faint, and help us find Racky."
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Thump!  Help us find
Racky!" and Rod pointed to the marks
on the ground.
</p>

<p>
Thump knew what this meant, of
course.  He could tell that the rocking
chair had come this way, and now Thump
knew the children were seeking Racky.
What should Thump do?
</p>

<p>
"I can lead those children on the wrong
trail, away from where Racky went, and
tease them off into the deep woods, where
they can never find that chair," thought
Thump to himself.  "I can do that, or I
can lead them straight to where Racky is
hiding.  He cannot be far off, for he is a
slow rocker."
</p>

<p>
Then Thump thought again:
</p>

<p>
"If I lead the children to Racky, he
will never forgive me, for he does not
want to be found and brought back to
Happy Home.  But winter is coming on,
there will be snow and ice, soon.  Racky
may catch cold in his legs.  I think it will
be best if the children find him and bring
him home.  After all, he may thank me
for it.  Perhaps Grandma Marden will
not sit on him so hard after he comes
back.  Yes, I'll lead the children to
Racky!"
</p>

<p>
Having thus made up his mind to do
something that, perhaps, the chair might
not like, at first, Thump just went ahead
and did it.  He sniffed at the tracks and
started off on a run, barking loudly.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" shouted Rodney, who
knew, by these signs, that his dog was
"on the trail," as it is called.  "Thump
will lead us just where the chair went!
Now we'll find it!"
</p>

<p>
"And Grandma's glasses, too, I hope!"
murmured Weezie, as she and Addie
followed the two boys.
</p>

<p>
Thump ran quite fast, and so did Nat
and Rod.  The girls tried to keep up with
their brothers, but it was hard work.
Once Addie fell down, and bruised her
knees, but she got up again, without
crying, and hurried on.  And once Weezie's
dress caught on a bramble bush and was
torn.  But Rodney happened to have a
safety pin in his pocket, so the dress was
mended, after a fashion, and the chase
kept up.
</p>

<p>
The children, led by the dog, reached
the top of the hill, down which Racky had
coasted.  Here the trail was so faint that
the children could not see it on the grass.
But with Thump along, to sniff at the
track left by the chair, they were able to
follow.
</p>

<p>
Down the hill, and up to the cottage of
the Singing Girl, Thump led the way.
The dog was barking loudly and the
Singing Girl opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hello, Children and Dog!" she
greeted them, pausing in her song.
"What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"We are after a runaway rocking
chair," answered Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen it?" asked Rodney,
politely taking off his cap, which Nat did,
also, a moment later.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," replied the Singing Girl.
"Yesterday I found a brown rocking
chair outside our door.  It came sliding
down the hill, and I lassoed it with a
towel and took it inside."
</p>

<p>
"Is it there now?" asked Weezie
eagerly, "and has it cushions on with
Grandma's glasses in?"
</p>

<p>
"The chair had cushions," answered
the Singing Girl, "but it is gone, now.
Some one came in the night and took it."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Nat, slowly shaking his
head, "no one took the chair away.  It
ran off by itself, just as it did from our
house."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I never heard of such a thing!"
exclaimed the Singing Girl, with a laugh.
"A runaway rocking chair!  Truly,
though, I saw it come sliding down hill,
but I thought it had fallen off some
moving wagon!"
</p>

<p>
"No, it ran away from us and it ran
away from you," explained Nat.  "Well,
we are on Racky's trail, anyhow.  He has
been here and gone away.  Come on!"
he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead, Thump!" ordered his
master, and the dog, who had been
impatiently leaping around, for he knew the
chair was no longer in the cottage, started
off through the woods.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you find Racky!" the Singing
Girl called to the children, as they ran
along after Thump.  Then she went back
in the cottage, humming a little tune.
</p>

<p>
On and on through the woods Thump
led Nat and the others on the trail of
Racky.  Well it was that the children
had the dog along for, without him, they
never would have been able to follow
Racky's winding trail.
</p>

<p>
But Thump led them to the cave in the
side of the hill, where the chair had slept
the second night.  There were the marks
of his rockers going in, and the marks of
his rockers coming out.
</p>

<p>
"Racky isn't in there," reported Nat
and Rod, who ventured into the dim
cavern, which Weezie and Addie would not
do.
</p>

<p>
The wild pig, whose back had been so
kindly scratched by the chair, the squirrel
for whom Racky had cracked a nut, and
the mother rabbit whose little bunny had
been rocked to sleep, were no longer in
the cave, so they could not tell the
children where Racky had gone.
</p>

<p>
"But Thump will find him!" declared
Rodney.  "Go on!" he called to his pet,
and the dog, looking back to see that the
children were following, led the way
deeper into the forest.
</p>

<p>
And then, all of a sudden, it began to
snow.  The storm swooped down over the
children, just as it had done over Racky,
who was swaying his way along, hardly
knowing where he was going or what to do.
</p>

<p>
But while Racky did not like the swirling,
white flakes, the children did, laughing
and shouting in glee as they felt the
melting, white crystals cool their warm,
red cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Hurray!  Hurray!  Hurray!" they
shouted.  "It's snowing!  It's snowing!
Soon it will be Thanksgiving and
Christmas!  Santa Claus will come with his
sleigh and reindeer when it snows!
Hurray!  Hurray!  Hurray!"
</p>

<p>
But as the snow came down thicker and
faster, the children could not see which
way to go.  They were in the middle of the
woods.  Even Thump did not know what
to do, for now he could no longer sniff at
the track, or trail, made by the runaway
rocker.  The snow had quite covered it.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it would be easier in the
snow, but it's harder," said Nat.
</p>

<p>
"What are we going to do?" asked
his sister.  "I like the snow, but I don't
want to be lost in the storm."
</p>

<p>
"I guess we'd better go home," murmured Addie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed Weezie.  "Do you know
which way home is?" she inquired of her
brother.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not exactly," Nat replied.  "But
I guess Rod knows."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't, either," confessed
Rodney.  "But I'm sure Thump does!  Hi,
Thump!" he called to his pet.  "Take us
home!"
</p>

<p>
But, instead of barking, and rushing off
through the storm as he should have done,
Thump drooped his tail between his legs
and whimpered, cuddling close to Rodney's
legs.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's afraid of something!" whispered
Addie.  "Thump doesn't know how
to lead us home.  He's lost, too, and he's
afraid of something!"
</p>

<p>
Truly, the dog did act strange, and as
if a little fearful of what was going to
happen.  The wind was howling and
moaning through the bare branches of
the trees.  The snow flakes were swirling
down thicker than ever.  All about the
children was a pale, frosty mist through
which they could see nothing.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Weezie whispered:
</p>

<p>
"I hear some one coming!"
</p>

<p>
They all listened.  Above the noise of
the storm they could hear the breaking
and snapping of twigs and branches on
the ground, as heavy feet trod on them.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe it's the circus elephant coming
for us," said Addie in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Elephants don't come out in winter,"
declared Nat.  "It's too cold for them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, look!" cried Weezie.  "See there!"
</p>

<p>
She pointed off among the trees and
there, walking through the storm, toward
the children, was a little old woman,
wrapped in a big fur coat.  She tramped
over the snow and over the underbrush
like a man.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me!" cried the old woman,
waving her hands toward the children.
"Come with me and bring your dog!"

<br>
&quot;COME WITH ME!&quot; CRIED THE OLD WOMAN.
</p>

<p>
And, hardly knowing why they did so,
the children followed the strange woman
through the storm, with Thump whining
and keeping close to Rodney and Nat.

<h3>
ADVENTURE IX
<br><br>
SANTA CLAUS
</h3>

<p>
For Racky, caught out in the snow
storm, just as the children had been, did
not know what to do.  The cold, white
flakes swirled around his legs, and fell on
his stiff, wooden arms, chilling him all
the way into his glue, by which he was held
together.
</p>

<p>
"If the snow gets into my cracks, it
will melt, and be just like rain," thought
Racky as he swayed along.  "Then I shall
fall apart!  Or I shall get the rheumatism,
and creak worse, than when fat Grandma
sits on me!  Oh, dear!  I almost wish I
had not run away!"
</p>

<p>
He found that he could travel faster
though, with the snow on the ground.
For he would rock a little way, then
suddenly stop, and he would slide ahead ten
feet or more, just as children do on a
slippery place.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there is something good in the
snow, anyhow," said the chair to himself.
"I can go very fast on it."
</p>

<p>
But it was getting colder, and the flakes
were now so thick that Racky could hardly
see more than a little distance in front of
him.  Once, after a slide, he bumped into
an evergreen tree, whose thick branches
were white with the crystal flakes.
</p>

<p>
"Whoa there!" exclaimed the tree.
"Where are you going, chair?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, excuse me!" murmured Racky.
"I am so sorry!  I didn't mean to bump
into you.  But I am running away, and
the snow blinded me!"
</p>

<p>
"That is quite all right," sighed the
evergreen tree, kindly.  "I have often
thought, myself, that I would like to run
away.  But I am rooted fast in the ground
and must stay here forever.  Tell me, is it
nice to run away?"
</p>

<p>
"It was at first," answered Racky, "but
I am not so sure about it, now.  I have
had some wonderful adventures, and I
may have more.  But just now the snow
is sifting down my back and I fear&mdash;a-ker-choo!"
he suddenly sneezed.  "I fear I
am catching a&mdash;ker-snitzio&mdash;I beg your
pardon&mdash;I fear I am catching cold!"
</p>

<p>
"I am quite certain of it," said the tree.
"But if you want shelter from the storm,
rock yourself in beneath my thick
branches."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I will," said Racky, noticing
that the low-hanging boughs of the
evergreen tree made a sort of tent.
</p>

<p>
Even during the short time the chair
had been standing still, talking to the tree,
the snow had drifted over his rockers, so
that now, when he wanted to move again
he found it not easy.  But he swayed to
and fro, and, at last, managed to get in
beneath the thick, green branches.
</p>

<p>
It was warmer there, almost as warm
and sheltered as it had been in the cave,
and Racky was thinking he could stay
there until the storm was over, when, all
of a sudden, he sneezed again:
</p>

<p>
"Ker-choo!  Ker-foo!  Ker-snitzio!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that isn't so good!" sighed the
tree.  "You have sneezed three times at
once."
</p>

<p>
"What is that a sign of?" asked Racky.
</p>

<p>
"I should say it was a sign that you
now have a cold, and ought to be in a snug,
warm place, near a blazing, hot fire,"
answered the tree.  "I fear it is a bit breezy
out here, even under my thick, green
branches."
</p>

<p>
This was quite true, and then, as Racky
stood there, shivering in spite of the warm
cushions, all at once a shower of snow
fell on him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried the chair.
</p>

<p>
"It's too bad, but it can't be helped,"
said the evergreen.  "You see my branches
are covered with snow, and when the wind
blows it shakes the snow off so that it falls
on you.  I am very sorry!"
</p>

<p>
"I am catching more&mdash;a-ker-choo&mdash;more
cold!" sneezed the chair.  "Is there
no place, Tree, where I could be warm
and sheltered?  Is there no place where I
can go in, to be away from the storm?
After it is over I shall keep on
adventuring."
</p>

<p>
The evergreen thought for a moment
and then, as the wind again shook its
branches, sifting more snow down on poor
Racky, the tree said:
</p>

<p>
"Just beyond this patch of woods,
where I am rooted, is a little house."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a little house!" murmured Racky.
"That sounds comforting!  And is there
a fire in the little house?"
</p>

<p>
"There must be," answered the evergreen,
"a warm, blazing fire.  For a little
old woman lives in the house and, each
day, she comes here to the forest to gather
up sticks for her fire.  So it must be warm
there."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could go in the little house,"
sighed Racky.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you?" asked the tree.  "I
am glad to have you here, under me, but I
cannot help sifting snow on you when the
wind blows.  And it is too breezy for one
who is catching cold.  The little old
woman is kind.  I am sure she will let
you come in her house."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am going there, thank you,"
said Racky, who was now shivering so
that he almost shook Grandma's glasses
out from between the cushions.  "How can
I find the little house?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Bock yourself straight through the
woods until you come to a big rock,"
answered the tree.  "Around the corner of
that rock stands the house of the little old
woman."
</p>

<p>
And so, with many thanks to the kind
evergreen, Racky swayed out from
beneath the sheltering branches into the
storm again.  The wind was blowing
harder now, and the snow was swirling
down more thickly.  It was all the chair
could do to slide along.  But he held his
wooden arms stiffly to his sides, and
swayed forward until he came within
sight of the big rock, and then he noticed
the little house.
</p>

<p>
Just as Racky looked, he saw the little
old woman, in the big fur coat, leading
four children and a dog into her cottage.
At the sight of them, the chair shrunk
back behind the shelter of the great rock.
</p>

<p>
"The tree said nothing about children
and a dog," murmured the chair.  "I
wonder if this is the right house?  I
couldn't see those boys and girls very well,
nor the dog, either.  But if they are
going to live in the cottage, there may be no
room for me."
</p>

<p>
Then the runaway rocker thought of
something else.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if they could be the children
from the Happy Home where I used to
live?" mused Racky.  "I wonder if they
could be Nat and Weezie, with Rodney
and Addie?  And perhaps that dog was
Thump.  But&mdash;no&mdash;they would not be so
far from home in the storm.  They must
be some other children.  I will wait a bit,
and then I will knock on the door.  The
little old woman may be kind enough to
take me in."
</p>

<p>
But, though Racky was not certain of
it, those children were the very ones he
had mentioned&mdash;Nat and his sister,
Rodney and Addie, and Thump the dog.  The
little old woman had seen them in the
storm-swept woods.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing out in the snow?"
she had asked them.
</p>

<p>
"We are trying to find our runaway
rocking chair, with Grandma's glasses
in," answered Nat.  He and the other
children were no longer frightened, nor
worried about being lost in the storm,
once they had seen, through the mist of
swirling flakes, the kind face of the little
old woman.
</p>

<p>
"A runaway rocking chair!" she
laughed.  "I never heard of such a thing,
though I know about lost glasses, for I
often lose my own.  But come to my house
out of the storm!"
</p>

<p>
She led the way, and soon the children
were snug and warm in the cottage.
Racky had seen them go in, but, as I have
told you, he was not certain that they
were the same children whom he knew.
So he stood there in the storm, not
knowing what to do.
</p>

<p>
It did not take the little old woman long
to draw chairs up to the bright, blazing
fire on the hearth, so the children could sit
in them and get warm.  Thump, the dog,
curled up in a round ball on the hearth,
as near the blaze as he dared to go without
burning his tail.
</p>

<p>
"Now, would you like something to
eat?" asked the little old woman.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;would we?" murmured the boys,
while the girls bashfully whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, very much indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Then here you are!" cried the little
old woman, and she set on the table a plate
of molasses cookies and a pitcher of milk,
with four glasses.  Thump looked up from
his place on the hearth, hungrily sniffing.
</p>

<p>
"You shall have your share, too," said
the little old lady.  "I have a juicy bone
in my cupboard for you!"
</p>

<p>
Soon Thump was gnawing the bone,
and the children were eating cookies and
drinking milk.  The little old lady sat in
a deep, easy chair near the blazing fire
and said:
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me more about yourselves,
my dears; and this strange story about
the runaway rocker.  Also, tell me where
you live, and I will try to think of a way
to send you home, though I cannot take
you myself.  Tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
But before any of them could answer,
Weezie, with a queer little, catching
sound in her breath, pointed to a window
and exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Look!  There's Santa Claus!"
</p>

<p>
And through the glass, a white frame
of snow around his face, the other
children could see an old man, with
apple-red cheeks and long, white whiskers,
peering in at them.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is Santa Claus!" murmured
Addie, and she dropped a piece of cookie
into her glass of milk with a little ploppy
splash!
</p>

<h3>
ADVENTURE X
<br><br>
THE RATTLE-BANG
</h3>

<p>
"Come out here a minute, Mrs. Chimney!"
called the red-cheeked, old man as
he tapped on the snow-covered window.
"Come out here, and see what this is,
Mrs. Chimney!"
</p>

<p>
"If that is Santa Claus, why doesn't
he come in?" asked Weezie.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he's afraid of us," suggested
Addie.  "Santa Claus doesn't like
children to see him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, it isn't that!" laughed the little
old woman.
</p>

<p>
"And why does he call you Mrs. Chimney?"
asked Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he said he wanted to get down
the chimney," suggested Nat.  "That's
what Santa Claus always wants to do;
though it isn't Christmas yet, nor even
Thanksgiving.  But he said <i>something</i>
about a chimney."
</p>

<p>
And the white-whiskered man tapped
on the snow-covered pane again, and
called:
</p>

<p>
"Come out, Mrs. Chimney!  Come out!"
</p>

<p>
"He calls me Mrs. Chimney, just for
fun, because he once mended my chimney
when the wind blew off some bricks,"
explained the little old woman.  "But
Chimney isn't really my name."
</p>

<p>
"Is Santa Claus <i>his</i> name?" asked
Weezie, who was now not quite so sure of
her first guess, since she could neither
see any reindeer nor any pack on the old
man's back.
</p>

<p>
"No, he isn't Santa Claus, though he
looks like the kind old Saint, my dears,"
said Mrs. Chimney, as she had been called.
"But I must go out and see what he
wants."
</p>

<p>
She opened the door of her cottage.
The red-cheeked, old man left the window
and stood on the front steps, as the
children could see when the door was open.
They could also see something else.  They
held their breaths in wonderment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, see!" murmured Weezie, pointing
a trembling finger.
</p>

<p>
But before the others could gasp out
their surprises, the old man exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Look, Mrs. Chimney, coming through
the storm I saw this old rocking chair
sliding along.  It slid right up to your
door and seemed about to knock.  Perhaps
it wants to come in out of the snow.
I thought I'd better tell you.  The chair
rocked itself down the hill, from around
the edge of the big rock."
</p>

<p>
"You mean the wind blew it," said
Chimney with a smile.  "A chair can't
rock itself down hill."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes it can!  This chair can!"
cried Nat.  "This is our chair, Racky,
that ran away.  That's the chair we have
been looking for!"  He was all excited,
and so were the other children.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's Racky!" echoed Weezie.
</p>

<p>
The children crowded to the open door,
through which the late afternoon wind
blew little flakes of snow.
</p>

<p>
"It's your Grandmother's rocking
chair!" added Rod.  "Sure it is!"
</p>

<p>
"And here are her glasses!" cried
Addie, slipping her hand in between the
cushions, and taking out the spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I do declare!" cried Mrs. Chimney,
looking wonderingly at the boys and
girls.  Thump shuffled out on the steps
and barked a welcome to his old friend
Racky, saying:
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry you can't run away any
more.  I led the children on your trail.
I hope you will forgive me."
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," said Racky.  "I'll
forgive you.  I'm glad they have found
me.  Or, rather, I am glad I came where
the children were.  I couldn't stand it to
be out in the storm any longer.  I was
catching cold, and getting a pain in my
legs and back.  It wasn't your fault,
Thump.  I saw the children come in here,
though, at first, I didn't believe they were
the ones I knew.  And I wasn't sure it
was you, Thump.  But I am tired of
running away and having adventures.  I have
had enough.  I am ready to go back to
Happy Home!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad," barked the dog.  "We'll
all go together."
</p>

<p>
Of course this talk between Thump and
Racky was not heard by the children, nor
by Mrs. Chimney nor by Santa Claus, as
the boys and girls still called the old man.
</p>

<p>
"This chair must have fallen off a moving
wagon in the storm, and the wind blew
it along, so you thought it was rocking
itself," said Mrs. Chimney, making the
same mistake as had the Singing Girl.
</p>

<p>
"I saw that chair, ma'am, as plainly as
I see you, shuffle along until it got to your
door," declared Santa Claus.  "It was
going to knock with its rockers or arms,
I verily believe, so you would take it in."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" laughed Mrs. Chimney.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but it's true!" exclaimed Nat.
"The chair ran away."
</p>

<p>
"Just like our gas stove," added
Weezie.
</p>

<p>
"Well, have it as you like," said
Mrs. Chimney with a laughing look at Santa
Claus.  "But I am sure of one thing, and
that is you children ran away, or walked
away, from home, and your folks will be
worried."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they may be," admitted Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"We'd like to go home, though it's
lovely here," said Addie, politely.
</p>

<p>
"And I can take you home, if you don't
mind riding in a rattle-bang," said the
old man who looked like Santa Claus,
though he really wasn't.
</p>

<p>
"What's a rattle-bang?" Nat wanted
to know.
</p>

<p>
"It's an old rattling, banging trap of a
wagon, hauled by an old, bony horse, that
I drive around collecting rags in,"
explained Santa Claus, which, though they
knew he wasn't, the children always,
afterward, called him.  "I'm a sort of a
junker," he went on, "and my wagon is
a rattle-bang.  But my horse is strong, if
he is bony, and my wagon has a cover on,
to keep out the snow.  So, if you would
like to ride with me, I'll take you home."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where we live?" asked
Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," was the answer.  "I have
often passed your houses, and seen you
children playing in the street.  I can take
you home.  It isn't far from here.  Just
down the lane and across the fields."
</p>

<p>
"I'll drive my wagon around," promised
the red-cheeked man.  "It will be
here in a minute!"
</p>

<p>
Off he shuffled, through the snow, and
soon the children heard a rattling, banging
sound as the bony horse drew the junk
wagon up to the door of Mrs. Chimney's
cottage.  First, into the wagon was lifted
Racky, for he would have found it hard,
stiff and cold as he was, to climb up by
himself.  Then in leaped Thump,
cuddling down on the chair's warm seat
cushion.  Then in climbed the children.
</p>

<p>
"Gid-dap!" cried Santa Claus to his
bony horse and away he started through
the storm.
</p>

<p>
"Come and see me again, sometime, my
dears!" invited Mrs. Chimney.
</p>

<p>
"We will!" promised Nat, Rodney,
Weezie and Addie.  "We will!"
</p>

<p>
And so, riding in the rattle-bang,
through the storm, they reached their
homes just about supper time.  Mr. and
Mrs. Marden and Mr. and Mrs. Trent
were then getting worried about the
children, and were thinking of having
Policeman Paddock go in search of them.
</p>

<p>
"But here they are, safe and sound!"
cried Santa Claus, as he stopped his bony
horse and rattle-bang wagon.
</p>

<p>
"Where in the world have you been?"
asked Mrs. Marden.
</p>

<p>
"We went after Racky, the runaway
rocker, and we found him!" cried Nat in
a jolly voice.
</p>

<p>
"And we found Grandma's glasses,
too!" added Weezie, holding up the
spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I declare!" exclaimed the fat
old lady.  "They are my glasses!  But
you never can make me believe that Racky
ran away by himself!  A tramp took him,
and left him in the field where you found
him; that's how it happened!  I know!"
</p>

<p>
"But, Grandma," said Weezie as Rod
and Addie, with their dog Thump, hurried
over to their own house, "we found Racky
at Mrs. Chimney's cottage!"
</p>

<p>
"And he was just about to knock on
the door, so she would take him in out of
the storm," said Santa Claus.
</p>

<p>
"Stuff and nonsense!  Stuff and
nonsense!" laughed Grandma.  "But I am
delighted to have back my old rocker and
my glasses," and, sitting very gently
down in the chair, so that it creaked
hardly at all, the old lady swayed to and
fro, and, putting on her glasses, began
to read the paper.
</p>

<p>
The snow rattled on the windows.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm glad you children are safe
home out of the storm," said their father
as he thanked Santa Claus for bringing
them back.
</p>

<p>
And that night, when all was still and
quiet in Happy Home, the chair called
down the stairs to Gassy in the laundry:
</p>

<p>
"I had some wonderful adventures.
I'll tell you about them sometime."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do," invited the gas stove.  "But
not now.  I am going to sleep."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," murmured Racky.
</p>

<p>
And so, for a time, the strange happenings
in Happy Home came to an end, but
not for very long.  Because, shortly after
that, as you may read in the next book
of this series, there were other queer
events.  I shall tell you about them in a
new story, to be called: "Adventures of
the Traveling Table," and I hope you will
like it.
</p>

<p>
The next day Grandma rocked to and
fro in her chair, and polished her glasses,
ready to bake another cake.
</p>

<p>
"They tell me you ran away," she said
to Racky, just as if he could understand,
which he could, though the old lady didn't
know it.  "They tell me you ran away!
Nonsense!  A tramp took you!"
</p>

<p>
But we know better than that; don't we?
</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
